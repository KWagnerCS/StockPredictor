On the economic data front, stronger-than-expected consumer confidence added to positive sentiment, after the Conference Board announced Tuesday, rose in July to 121.1 to a 16-year high.

Despite the rally on Wall Street, investors had to contend with a nearly 3% slump in the shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), after the tech giant quarterly earnings on Monday, revealed a 27% dip in profit, following the 2.7 billion fine levied by European Union in June.

Meanwhile, US political jitters eased somewhat, after Senate Republicans to floor debate on thier efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co (N: ) said on Monday it has set up an avionics group to make flight controls and other electronics currently made by outside suppliers for its commercial and military aircraft, aiming to bring the products into service after 2020.

The move by the world's largest plane maker appeared to be a direct attack on suppliers such as Rockwell Collins Inc (N: ), United Technologies Corp (N: ) and Honeywell International Inc (N: ).

The three companies, which make electronics used on current Boeing jets, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In recent years, Boeing has brought propulsion, carbon fiber manufacturing and other key capabilities in-house to better control both technology and intellectual property. That strategy followed outsourcing of major systems to suppliers for the 787 Dreamliner that led to billions of dollars in cost overruns.

Boeing said it has already started developing systems that would be lower cost, higher quality alternatives to existing products made by suppliers, and would deliver more services revenue to Boeing after a plane is sold.

Boeing aims to ""further drive cost down and value up for our customers, in all phases of a product's life cycle,"" Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said in an internal statement to employees that was seen by Reuters.

While Boeing owns some intellectual property on electronic systems in its jet cockpits, current contracts with suppliers likely would not let Boeing take aftermarket business away on those planes, said analyst Robert Stallard.

However, suppliers could lose significant business on future aircraft, Stallard said.

Boeing is talking about creating a new mid-sized aircraft that would enter service around 2025, and would need to create a successor to its best-selling 737 model after that.

Investing.com – The rally in the Dow showed no sign of ending, closing at a record high on Thursday, led by a jump in shares of Apple after the tech giant posted better-than-expected earnings for the quarter on Wednesday after markets closed.

Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) gained more than 4%, supporting a move higher in the Dow to a record 22,000, after the tech giant posted earnings that beat on both the bottom and top lines, benefiting from steady iPhone sales.

The company reported earnings per share of $1.67 on $45.4 billion in revenue. Analyst had forecast earnings per share of $1.57 on $44.89 billion in revenue.

Economic data, however, weighed on gains after private sector job creation for July, fell short of expectations.

ADP and Moody's Analytics said added just 178,000 jobs for the month, short of analysts’ forecasts of 185,000.

The weaker-than-expected private payrolls report comes two days ahead of nonfarm payrolls data due Friday, pointing to a possible slowdown in the U.S. labor market, adding to expectations the Federal Reserve may abandon its plan to hike rates at least once more this year.

Better-than-expected earnings for the quarter has been one of the key drivers of the recent rally, as recent data showed more than 73% of the S&P 500 companies had reported earnings that beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines.

By Tim Hepher

TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus delivered 47 aircraft in July to reach the half-way point in its target for the year, but its narrowbody A320neo family continues to feel the disruption from delays in getting the latest generation of engines from their manufacturers.

The European planemaker said on Friday it had delivered 9 of the upgraded medium-haul jetliners in July, bringing total A320neo-family deliveries so far this year to 68, just a third of the full-year target of 200 for that model.

Airbus said last week its earnings had been hit by delays in receiving engines for the aircraft type and increased pressure on engine supplier Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (N: ) that has been hampered by a series of glitches.

Total Airbus airplane deliveries between January and July reached 353 aircraft, propelled by brisk deliveries of the earlier A320 model, Airbus said in a monthly data release. That compares with a full-year target of around 700.

Evidence of the ongoing A320neo engine disruption could be seen on Friday in clusters of undelivered jets jammed into tight spaces around the perimeter of the Toulouse aerodrome where the world's second-largest planemaker has its main factory.

Some two dozen aircraft were visible from the roadside, painted in the livery of their airline customers but yet to receive their engines or in some cases wingtip extensions.

The majority of the jets are destined for airlines that have selected Pratt & Whitney's new Geared Turbofan engine, but a handful are also waiting for engines from CFM International, co-owned by General Electric (N: ) and Safran (PA: ).

A Reuters tally of jets parked without engines included six built for India: four for GoAir, a Pratt & Whitney customer, and two for CFM customer Air India. India said on Thursday Pratt & Whitney had promised a solution by September.

Others with as yet unpowered jets included Mexico's Volaris.

Asked to comment on the number of undelivered jets, an Airbus spokesman said it had delivered many more than at the same point last year, when A320neo output was in early stages, but that it had ""expected to be more advanced"" by mid 2017.

""We still target full-year A320neo deliveries to be around 200 but in view of the engine issues, this target becomes more challenging,"" he said.

Airbus introduced a caveat into its 2017 forecasts last week, saying its target of more than 700 jetliner deliveries depended on its engine suppliers.

Airbus meanwhile said on Friday it had sold four aircraft in July - typically a quiet month in odd-numbered years coming after the Paris Airshow - to reach 252 for the year.

That total fell to 205 after cancellations, leaving Airbus behind U.S. rival Boeing (N: ) in this year's order race.

Boeing has posted 446 orders through July 25, or 386 when adjusted for cancellations.

July's orders included one Airbus A350-1000, a large twin-engined jet due for its first delivery by the end of this year.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/airbus-deliveries-remain-hampered-by-engine-delays-514883,0.017,0.941,0.042,0.8534

At a rally in Arizona Tuesday night, Trump said: ""If we have to close down our government, we're building that wall.""

Investor fears over delays to the Trump’s administration economic agenda come a day after a report on Tuesday suggested that the Trump administration and key lawmakers had found common ground on how to approach tax reform.

Investor focus, however, is expected to shift to monetary policy on Thursday as a two-day central banking symposium gets underway in Jackson Hole. Speeches by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and Janet Yellen are expected to be closely monitored for clues about future monetary policy.

Meanwhile on the corporate earnings front, investors cheered better-than-expected earnings from HP after US markets closed on Wednesday. The computer and printer manufacturer’s net income, however, fell 13% compared to same period a year ago. Shares of HP Inc (NYSE: ) fell more than 3% in after hours trade.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Pratt and Whitney has told India it will provide replacement engines for grounded A320neo aircraft operated by IndiGo and GoAir airlines by the end of September, a civil aviation ministry official said on Thursday.

Eight IndiGo planes and two GoAir jets are grounded because the carriers cannot get replacement engines from Pratt and Whitney, which is owned by United Technologies (N: ).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York-based private equity firm Veritas Capital is exploring the sale of two high-tech portfolio companies, worth nearly $3 billion in total, as it looks to raise cash to fund new deals this Fall, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The potential sales of electronics component maker Excelitas Technologies Corp and radar component-maker Anaren Inc would be a major boost for the U.S. aerospace and defense-related M&A landscape, which has seen just $1 billion worth of deals so far this year - a 46 percent drop on the same period in 2016.

Veritas has hired investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ) to pursue a so-called dual track sale process for Excelitas which could see the Massachusetts-based company sold outright or floated via an initial public offering, the people said. If successful, Excelitas could fetch as much as $2 billion, they added.

The private equity firm, which has investments in several national security and tech-sector assets, has also hired bankers to offload Anaren in a separate deal that could be worth more than $800 million, the same people told Reuters.

Spokespeople for Veritas and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Excelitas and Anaren did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the talks.

Excelitas makes products such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and flash lamps which are used in applications ranging from medical lighting to aerospace and defense equipment.

Anaren produces microwave components for wireless, space and defense electronics providers and counts Raytheon Co, Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: )., and Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE: ) as customers.

The New York-based company's microwave assemblies are used in the United States' Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR), the system the U.S. military is developing to track intercontinental ballistic missiles launched from places like North Korea.

BARREN LANDSCAPE

Deals in the aerospace and defense industry have slowed this year after the election of President Donald Trump sent asset prices soaring, making many buyers hold off on deals.

Bucking the trend is a potential $20-plus billion mega-deal between two aircraft parts-makers United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ) and Rockwell Collins Inc (NYSE: ), first reported on 4 August.

The barren landscape could be could be good for Veritas, with many cash-rich buyers on the scout for assets, but the sensitive nature of the technology involved is also expected to invite intense U.S. regulatory scrutiny, bankers said.

Veritas created Excelitas by acquiring the former illumination and detection solutions business of scientific instruments maker PerkinElmer Inc (NYSE: ). for about $500 million in 2010.

Excelitas went on to acquire more companies, including Kaiser Systems Inc, a manufacturer of high-voltage power systems, and Qioptiq, a maker of specialized optical components and lenses.

Veritas had previously attempted to sell Excelitas in 2014, Reuters reported at the time, but no deal was reached.

In 2014, Veritas paid $383 million to take Anaren private, delisting it from the NASDAQ stock exchange.

Both sales are in their early stages and could be called off at any time, the people said.",https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/veritas-capital-explores-2-billion-sale-ipo-of-electronics-component-maker-excelitas-sources-522588,0.008,0.925,0.068,0.9571

President Donald Trump said in a statement Tuesday that ""all options are on the table"" for dealing with North Korea.

Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist to Trump, said in an interview with the American Prospect earlier this month that there is ""no military solution"" to North Korea.

Meanwhile, sentiment on technology stocks turned positive, after shares of Apple (NASDAQ: ) hit all-time highs, as anticipation builds for the tech giant’s upcoming product launches, rumored to include its latest smartphone, the iPhone 8.

A slump in energy stocks, however continued to weigh on the broader market as futures settled in negative territory for a second day in row as Storm Harvey continued to wreak havoc in Texas, the heart of the U.S. oil industry.

PARIS (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney's (N: ) grip on the regional turboprop market could come under threat after Europe's ATR said it would look closely at alternative engines for its planes in future.

Christian Scherer, who took over as chief executive of the world's largest maker of civil turboprops last year, told Reuters on Wednesday he would open the door to other potential suppliers as soon as he could.

Pratt, which is struggling to reassert itself in the passenger jet market, enjoys an effective monopoly in the market for smaller regional turboprops via its Canadian subsidiary.

ATR and Canada's Bombardier (TO: ) dominate the market of about 100 aircraft a year and both exclusively use PW&C engines.

The most obvious beneficiary from any decision by ATR to switch engine suppliers would be General Electric (N: ) which is developing an ""Advanced Turboprop"", so far aimed at the business and general aviation markets.

Planemakers and airlines typically prefer competition in the engine market in order to drive down the prices for engines and the all-important aftermarket services.

Although China is vying to enter the turboprop market with its Xian MA700 aircraft, even this is being developed with engines from PW&C, underlining the U.S. firm's strong position.

Scherer praised Pratt & Whitney Canada professionalism, but said he was concerned about its ""monopolistic"" position, adding he would seek to stimulate competition ""at the next available opportunity"".

""I don't say we won't continue with Pratt, but I will use the next opening I can to weaken the over-powerful position of a number of our suppliers,"" Scherer said.

Pratt & Whitney Canada was not immediately available for comment.

Industry sources said Scherer has reviewed suppliers and recently replaced Honeywell (N: ) as supplier of an air conditioning system in favor of Toulouse-based Liebherr Aerospace.

Any change in engine supplier would not take place immediately.

Franco-Italian ATR is pondering whether to update its family of two aircraft types with new engines and other improvements or go further and invest in an entirely new design.

But no decision is imminent as its shareholders - Airbus (PA: ) and Leonardo - (MI: ) can't agree on whether to put up the roughly $3 billion needed to develop a new turboprop.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/atr-challenges-pratts-hold-on-turboprop-engine-market-528485,0.033,0.912,0.054,0.7248

Deliveries of the newest member of Airbus's narrowbody jet family, which generates most of its profits, have been disrupted by delays in engine supply.

""It is painful to see so many aircraft on ground. Our first priority is to make sure that we can make the airline that has our engine and use the asset, which, by the way, is performing very well,"" United Tech Chief Financial Officer Akhil Johri said at a Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) conference.

Deliveries and reliability have been hit by teething problems with the newly developed Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine, including the combustion chamber and an engine seal.

""We are working right now with Airbus to see whether we want to reallocate or change the mix between engines that go towards new aircraft versus what goes into the lease pool this year...,"" Johri said.

United Tech, which struck a $30 billion deal to buy avionics and interiors maker Rockwell Collins Inc (N: ) last week, reaffirmed on Thursday it would deliver between 350 and 400 Pratt & Whitney GTF engines this year.

Last month, Airbus raised concern about the deal distracting United Tech from fixing industrial problems that have led to delay in new aircraft deliveries.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/united-tech-says-working-to-resolve-engine-delays-to-airbus-529074,0.05,0.854,0.096,0.9129

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp (N: ) is poised to announce a purchase of missile and rocket maker Orbital ATK Inc (N: ) as soon as Monday, a person familiar with the transaction said on Sunday.

The deal would come as the firing of missiles by North Korea in recent months has focused attention on missile defense systems.

With Orbital's stock market value of $6.3 billion and $1.4 billion of long-term debt, the deal's final value will likely exceed $7.7 billion.

Northrop Grumman declined to comment. Orbital did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Orbital's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure product lines would enlarge Northrop's offerings to its largest customer, the U.S. Department of Defense, analyst Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners LLC said in a research note on Sunday.

The deal is noteworthy not only because it boosts Northrop's exposure to missile defense, but also because the company has not bought a large rival in many years. It would also represent a departure from a focus of returning earnings to shareholders.

Orbital ATK has contracts with NASA as well as the U.S. Army and the deal would give Northrop more than $4.4 billion in annual revenue according to Orbital's 2016 financials.

Despite infrequent strategic mergers, Northrop has not shied away from bold corporate actions to please investors. In 2011 Northrop spun off its Huntington Ingalls Industries (N: ) shipbuilding business to shareholders. In 2009, it sold its government services business, TASC.

Northrop's last buying spree more than a decade ago included the 2002 purchase of TRW Inc for about $7.8 billion.

Based on Friday's closing stock price, Northrop was valued at $46.5 billion. The acquisition price could exceed $7.5 billion if a typical premium was attached to it, the Wall Street Journal said in a report published earlier on Sunday.

Another reason for the deal could be the Pentagon's efforts to rebuild missiles defenses. The Air Force had asked the defense industry last summer for proposals to replace the aging nuclear cruise missiles and intercontinental ballistic missile system as the military moved ahead with a costly modernization of its aging atomic weapons systems.

In August, Northrop received a $328 million contract to continue developing a replacement of the aging Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system for the U.S. Air Force.

Northrop is also the prime contractor for the B-21 bomber as well as the maker of the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle.

Orbital is a subcontractor for composite structures on the B-21, and Callan of Capital Alpha Partners said the deal might spark concerns at the Pentagon because of vertical integration within that program.

So far this year Orbital's stock has increased 25 percent as investors have eyed an increase in U.S. defense spending.

Earlier in September, aerospace supplier United Technologies Corp (N: ) agreed to buy avionics and interiors maker Rockwell Collins Inc (N: ) in $30 billion deal that would be the largest in the industry's history.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/northrop-grumman-nears-deal-to-purchase-orbital-source-529768,0.018,0.896,0.086,0.9836

Investing.com – The Dow Jones industrial average closed sharply higher on Wednesday, led by a surge in financials amid rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike rates for third time later this year.

The closed higher at 22,344.48. The closed 0.41% higher while the closed at 6453.26, up 1.15%.

A surge in financials lifted the broader market higher as the prospect of a year-end rate hike increased demand for bank stocks which usually benefit from a rising interest rate environment.

Higher interest rates are seen as boon for banks, boosting net interest margin – the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: ), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE: ) closed more than 1% higher.

Also adding to the rally on Wall Street was renewed investor hope for tax reform after the U.S. Congress and the White House unveiled plans to change America’s tax code in a proposal that slashes taxes on businesses the wealthy.

On the economic front investors digested a duo of mixed reports on the U.S. economy as durable goods orders grew while housing activity remained subdued.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.9 % last month after an upwardly revised 1.1% increase in July.

The housing sector, however, continued as the National Association of Realtors’ fell 2.6% to 106.3 in August. That was the lowest reading since January 2016.

In corporate news, shares of Nike (NYSE: ) slumped 3%, as an earnings report highlighted that revenues in Nike’s domestic market continued to decline.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus told European governments on Wednesday that it has made a strategic decision to bring the design of some nacelles or aircraft engine casings inside the company, rather than leaving it with suppliers, according to a presentation on its website.

It also said the troubled A400M military plane project will continue to ""weigh significantly"" on cashflow in 2017 and 2018 in particular, according to the presentation prepared on Oct. 4 and presented on Wednesday to governments that own shares in the European planemaker: France, Germany and Spain.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bombardier Inc's aerospace business spent $2.4 billion in the United States last year, tapping more than 800 suppliers in all but three U.S. states, according to a confidential Bombardier report seen by Reuters on Thursday.

The report shows the potential impact on the U.S. economy and companies if the Canadian company's new CSeries jetliner is effectively kept out of the U.S. market by a trade row initiated by Boeing (NYSE: ) Co earlier this year.

Boeing has accused Bombardier of receiving taxpayer subsidies that allowed it to sell the CSeries in the United States at prices below cost. Last week, the U.S. Department of Commerce proposed a duty of nearly 220 percent to compensate for the subsidies, and the agency is due to issue a decision on potential additional duties for dumping later on Thursday.

The imposition of additional duties would effectively keep Bombardier out of the United States because it would make its planes too expensive to be competitive

The report said more than half of the materials Bombardier buys for the new CSeries plane come from U.S. suppliers, with the most spending in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa and Kansas, the report said.

The duties, which would affect an order for 75 planes by Delta Air Lines (NYSE: ), would not take effect unless approved by the U.S. International Trade Commission early next year.

Bombardier has already said that its spending supports 22,700 jobs in the United States, and it has identified major CSeries suppliers such as Connecticut-based engine maker Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ), and Iowa-based avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc (NYSE: ). United Technologies is in the process of acquiring Rockwell Collins.

The report identifies the 10 largest CSeries suppliers, including French interiors supplier Zodiac Aerospace SA, through its operations in California; Honeywell International Inc (NYSE: ), which makes auxiliary power units in Arizona; Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc in Kansas; and Parker Aerospace, a unit of Parker-Hannifin Corp (NYSE: ) which has operations in Utah, California and Michigan.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bombardier-spends-24-billion-a-year-on-aerospace-in-us-document-537616,0.014,0.894,0.093,0.9866

ROTTWEIL, Germany (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE: ) is attracting strong demand for its next-generation elevators, which operate without steel cables or ropes, it said on Friday.

Based on magnetic-levitation technology developed for high-speed trains, the MULTI elevator moves from shaft to shaft with multiple cars in each, offering the potential to revolutionize the way people move within high-rise buildings.

The German group is banking on MULTI as well as internet-connected elevators as it strives to become a technology conglomerate and shift away from its core steelmaking business, which it plans to merge with Tata Steel (NS: ).

""Demand is gigantic,"" Andreas Schierenbeck, chief executive of Thyssenkrupp Elevator, told Reuters.

The company plans a gradual introduction of the MULTI, he said, aiming for two or three more initial customers to follow the first order announced for a high-rise building in Berlin.

""Demand is currently much higher than what we have in mind,"" Schierenbeck said in Rottweil, where Thyssenkrupp operates its MULTI test tower, adding that a much broader customer base would be targeted once the product is established on the market.

Thyssenkrupp Elevator lifted adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by 8 percent to 860 million euros ($1 billion) in the financial year to Sept. 30 last year, accounting for 59 percent of the group total.

Competing with Otis (N: ), Mitsubishi Electric (T: ), Kone (HE: ) and Schindler (S: ), the elevators business is Thyssenkrupp's most profitable division with an adjusted EBIT margin of 11.5 percent.

Schierenbeck said the margin would grow to 12-12.2 percent for the year to Sept. 30, 2017, for which Thyssenkrupp will report results on Nov. 23. He also said it had targeted adjusted EBIT of 1 billion euros before 2020 and a margin of 15 percent at a later stage.

Demand in the United States was good and stable, Schierenbeck said, adding that China was difficult because of ""enormous"" pricing pressure amid fierce competition in a shrinking market.

""We're also a little worried about Spain due to the current political situation,"" Schierenbeck said, referring to the crisis sparked by Catalonia's independence referendum, which was ruled illegal by Spain's constitutional court.

""They had healthy growth and ... this could be threatened a bit,"" he said.

Thyssenkrupp Elevator makes 30 percent of its revenue in Europe, its second-biggest sales contributor behind the Americas, but does not provide a more detailed breakdown.

(Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (N: ) plans to spin off non-core assets and create at least two new publicly listed companies, as the U.S. industrial conglomerate seeks to streamline its business, according to people familiar with the matter.

The move would represent the first major shakeup at the Morris Plains, New Jersey-based company since Darius Adamczyk succeeded David Cote as chief executive in April. It comes after Honeywell said in September it would raise its annual dividend by 12 percent.

The sources said on Sunday that while Honeywell would defy calls by one of its shareholders, activist hedge fund Third Point LLC, to spin off its aerospace division, it would still seek to carve out assets worth several billions of dollars.

Honeywell is considering placing its turbochargers business, which produces components that improve the performance and efficiency of cars and trucks, into one of the newly created companies, the sources said. Honeywell lists turbochargers as part of its aerospace business.

The sources did not disclose which other assets Honeywell was looking to spin off and asked not to be identified because the deliberations were confidential.

Honeywell is hoping to unveil the spinoff plan as early as this week, though the announcement could be delayed, the sources added.

Honeywell, which has a market capitalization of $109 billion, declined to comment.

Honeywell's businesses include energy efficient products and solutions for homes, specialty chemicals, electronic and advanced materials, and sensing, safety and security technologies for buildings, homes and industries.

Third Point has argued that Honeywell is undervalued compared to peers in industrial automation, and that spinning off the entire aerospace business would create $20 billion in shareholder value.

Honeywell's aerospace business, its biggest, also makes auxiliary power units and engines for aircraft manufactured by companies such as Bombardier Inc (TO: ), Textron Inc (N: ) and General Dynamics Corp (N: ).

Last year, Honeywell approached peer United Technologies Corp (N: ) to discuss a potential combination but was rebuffed. Last month, United Technologies struck a $30 billion agreement to buy avionics and interiors maker Rockwell Collins Inc (N: ). Analysts have said this deal positions United Technologies to also spin off assets down the line, though no such deal has been announced.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-honeywell-prepares-to-spin-off-businesses-sources-538443,0.022,0.871,0.108,0.9776

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc (NYSE: ) said Tuesday it will focus on fewer business lines, including aerospace, and use spin offs of two other businesses to help fund acquisitions.

The reorganization will simplify Honeywell's broad portfolio, boost growth and give shareholders a tax-free benefit from the new companies, Honeywell Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk said on a conference call on Tuesday.

It also gives diversified manufacturer scope to further change its remaining portfolio along the lines sought by hedge fund Third Point Capital, which had agitated for a spin off of aerospace since April. Third Point said on Tuesday it was pleased with the changes and backed Adamczyk's leadership.

""We've got two exciting new businesses that we think can grow at an accelerated rate,"" Adamczyk said, referring to the spin-offs, which are due to be completed next year.

""I'm very excited about M&A in all four of our (remaining) businesses,"" he added. ""And I think these two spins ... give me a lot of different levers to invest our M&A dollars.""

Analysts praised the moves, but said Honeywell had more changes to make, and warned that the aerospace business, with products ranging from jet engines to airplane WiFi systems, may need to merge to gain the size to compete with larger rivals.

An aerospace spin-off or merger with General Electric (NYSE: ) Co's aerospace unit would make Honeywell a stronger competitor to United Technologies (NYSE: ) and a ""more powerful supplier to Boeing (NYSE: ) Co and Airbus SE,"" Scott Davis, analyst at Melius Research, wrote in a note. ""That's a deal worth thinking about.""

Honeywell shares were up marginally in New York trading, after falling 2.3 percent initially.

Adamczyk, like his peers at other industrial conglomerates, has been under pressure to pull apart a portfolio of disparate businesses that includes automotive turbo chargers, burglar alarms and the Xtratuf boots popular in Alaska's fishing industry.

Third Point had argued that a spin-off of aerospace, which accounted for about 38 percent of revenue in 2016, could generate $20 billion in shareholder value if sold.

One institutional investor said Honeywell left itself plenty of options - including making acquisitions with the remaining companies.

""This doesn't preclude them coming tomorrow with a reverse merger for aerospace,"" said the investor.

Honeywell said it will split off its home and ADI global distribution businesses, wholesale distributors of security, fire and environmental systems for homes and commercial buildings, into a public company. It will spin off its transportation systems business, which includes automotive turbochargers, into a second company.

The auto parts move follows other companies, including auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc, in that are shedding technology tied to the internal combustion engine as regulators around the world crack down on emissions and talk of mandating a switch to battery-electric vehicles over the next two decades.

Honeywell said the two spun-off business units together would generate annualized revenue of about $7.5 billion. It said it would gain $3 billion from the spin-offs.

Ahead of its quarterly earnings report on Oct. 20, the company said third-quarter sales were expected to be $10.1 billion, up 5 percent in organic terms higher than an earlier forecast range of up or down 1 percent.

Investing.com – U.S. stocks retreated from record highs weighed by a slump in financials as better-than-expected earnings from JP Morgan and Citigroup did little to lift sentiment on equities.

The closed lower at 22,841.01. The closed 0.17% lower while the closed at 6591.81, down 0.18%.

U.S. stocks started the session on the back foot as investors mulled over earnings reports from JP Morgan and Citigroup that beat on both the top on bottom lines.

Shares of both JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: ) and Citigroup Inc (NYSE: ) fell more than 1%, dragging the broader market into negative territory.

On the economic data front, labor market and wholesale inflation data topped expectations pointing to underlying strength in the U.S. economy.

The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that fell 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 258,000 for the week ended Oct. 7, beating forecasts of a 7,000 decline.

In a separate report, the U.S. Department of Labor said its for final demand increased 0.4% in September. In the 12 months through September, the PPI rose 2.2% after rising 2% in August.

Analysts have been quick to downplay the slump in U.S. stocks, insisting the recent upward trend in markets is not at risk of reversing as earnings will reflect strong fundamentals.

“Basic fundamentals are good, companies are making money, and I think the market will be relatively strong throughout earnings season, but I don’t see a huge spike up between now and the end of the year because a lot [of earnings optimism] has been priced in,” said Gary Droz, managing director at MainLine Private Wealth.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. aviation authorities have ordered visual inspections of fan hubs in engines used on some Airbus SE A380 jets after an engine came apart on an Air France flight last month, forcing it to make an emergency landing.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive requiring owners and operators of Engine Alliance (EA) Model GP7200 series engines to visually inspect the engines and remove the fan hub if defects are found.

The EA engines are manufactured by a 50-50 joint venture between General Electric (NYSE: ) Co and United Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp's Pratt & Whitney unit.

The FAA directive formalizes advice circulated by the engine company on Thursday. EA declined immediate comment.

GP7200 engines account for 60 percent of the global market share of engines that power Airbus A380 superjumbos currently in service, according to Corrine Png, the CEO of transport research firm Crucial Perspective.

In addition to Air France, the affected airlines include Emirates, the world's largest A380 operator, as well as Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Korean Air Lines Co.

The FAA said the directive, an interim measure, was prompted by the failure of the fan hub on the affected engine on the Air France aircraft.

""An investigation to determine the cause of the failure is on-going and we may consider additional rulemaking if final action is identified,"" it said in a statement.

Depending on the number of flight cycles, the inspections must be performed within the next two to eight weeks.

A380 aircraft powered by the rival Rolls-Royce (LON: ) Holdings PLC Trent 900 engine are not affected by the directive.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/faa-orders-a380-engine-inspections-after-air-france-incident-540966,0.065,0.87,0.065,-0.0516

TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus (PA: ) on Thursday began the maiden flight of its A330neo jetliner, an upgraded version of its profitable A330 line designed to sharpen competition with the latest version of Boeing's (N: ) 787 Dreamliner.

The wide-bodied, long-distance jet took off from the planemaker's Toulouse headquarters under overcast skies, watched by top executives from Airbus and Britain's Rolls-Royce (L: ), which supplies the engines.

In service since the 1990s, the A330 family is Airbus's biggest-selling wide-body jet but the arrival of Boeing's composite-body Dreamliner has eroded that advantage.

Airbus hopes the A330neo's refreshed design will help it defend its position in the lucrative 250-300 seat market.

Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said Airbus had decided to improve the plane's maximum take-off weight by around 4 percent to 251 tonnes so the A330neo can serve longer routes such as Kuala Lumpur to London.

Separately, Bregier said the company still expected to deliver around 200 A320neo aircraft in 2017, but added that reaching the target would be tough in the wake of delayed engine deliveries.

Bregier said Pratt & Whitney (N: ), whose industrial problems have delayed deliveries of jets at Airbus plants, was testing re-designed parts for its engines and expected to start delivering the modified version at the end of this year.

The majority of the jets are destined for airlines that have selected Pratt & Whitney’s new Geared Turbofan engine. CFM International, co-owned by General Electric (N: ) and Safran (PA: ), is also supplying engines for the A320neo.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/airbus-a330neo-plane-successfully-takes-off-on-maiden-flight-543995,0.03,0.911,0.058,0.8462

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA: ) is more confident in the ability of Pratt & Whitney (N: ) to speed up delayed engine shipments, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday, in a sign that supply-chain gridlock affecting European aircraft deliveries may soon reach its peak.

Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said in July that Pratt & Whitney's performance was ""unsatisfactory"" but a person familiar with the situation said on Monday the company had seen evidence the engine maker was overcoming its technical difficulties.

""The level of confidence is improving,"" a person close to Airbus said.

Airbus declined comment ahead of Oct. 31 earnings.

Its shares closed up 0.8 percent.

Pratt & Whitney declined comment.

Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbofan engine is one of two types of powerplant offered on the A320neo and its fuel-saving performance is tied to the sale of more than 5,000 Airbus jets.

A trio of technical problems has left over two dozen semi-completed jetliners parked without engines in Toulouse, driving Airbus profits down sharply at mid-year.

Pratt & Whitney has fixed two of the problems - concerning fan blades and an oil seal - and may report progress on a third one related to the combustion chamber on Tuesday when its parent reports quarterly earnings, industry sources said.

Airbus planemaking chief Fabrice Bregier said last week he expected engines with redesigned parts and a full service life to be delivered from end-year. He said Airbus's 2017 target of 200 A320neo deliveries was reachable but tough.

Any breakthrough would not come in time to help Airbus's third-quarter earnings, however.

Total Airbus deliveries fell 1.7 percent in the first nine months but those of single-aisle aircraft like the A320neo, which generate most Airbus profit and cash, fell 7.9 percent.

""We expect a weak third-quarter update with slow progress on the A320neo the key driver,"" Berenberg analysts said. Pratt & Whitney has repeatedly reaffirmed its target to build 350-400 engines this year.

But within that total, more engines than expected have been diverted from airplane production to a pool of spares for airlines needing to swap engines for premature checks. The problem has been especially severe in India.

Airlines can also choose engines from CFM International, co-owned by General Electric (N: ) and France's Safran (PA: ).

Airbus can alter the mix of aircraft powered by each type of engine on its production line, but needs four months' notice to decide which engines go on which airframe, meaning it has been left with aircraft for Pratt & Whitney customers but no engines.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tensions-ease-over-pratt-engine-supplies-to-airbus-sources-545968,0.054,0.87,0.076,0.8853

(Reuters) - Bombardier Inc (TO: ) said on Tuesday it was reviewing 2017 delivery plans for its CSeries jets, after U.S. engine parts maker United Technologies said it was resolving issues with its geared turbofan (GTF) engines to make them more durable.

United Technologies Corp (N: ), the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, held back some shipments of GTF engines to plane makers and offered spares to airlines, which had faced problems with engines already in service.

""Bombardier is working closely with Pratt & Whitney to evaluate and mitigate any potential impact on its customers and will provide a full update on November 2, when it issues its Q3 results,"" spokeswoman Nathalie Siphengphet said on Tuesday.

Both Bombardier and Airbus SE (PA: ) have faced delayed deliveries of separate GTF engines for their narrowbody programs.

Montreal-based Bombardier has forecast deliveries of about 30 CSeries jets this year, but has only delivered 12 so far, raising questions among some analysts about whether it will be able to meet its guidance.

""We've got some supplier challenges so you know, we'll see how the ramp up goes,"" Bombardier Commercial Aircraft President Fred Cromer told Reuters on Friday. He did not provide names of specific suppliers.

Korean Air Lines Co Ltd (KS: ), which was to take delivery of its first Bombardier CSeries in the coming weeks, has had the order of five jets delayed.

""The detailed schedules to introduce the models have not been decided,"" said a spokeswoman for Korean Air Lines in Seoul who declined to give a reason for the delay. ""We are in continued talks with the manufacturer.""

Two sources familiar with the matter said Pratt & Whitney was delayed in producing a corrected engine liner required for the Korean deliveries.

In April, Bombardier said Pratt would issue the liners for the engines in Korean's order for delivery this past summer.

At the time, Bombardier instructed CSeries operators Swiss International Air Lines and airBaltic to inspect their engine combustion liners after 2,000 flight hours. Pratt & Whitney said it had added a combustor lining inspection to its regularly scheduled maintenance of the engine.

A Pratt spokesman referred questions about Korean's deliveries and the engine liners to the carrier.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bombardier-reviewing-cseries-deliveries-due-to-utc-engine-fixes-546921,0.026,0.954,0.02,-0.5789

(Reuters) - Spare parts for Lockheed Martin Corp's (N: ) stealthy F-35 fighter jets are not keeping up with demand according to a report out on Thursday from the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

The report said ""from January through August 7, 2017, F-35 aircraft were unable to fly about 22 percent of the time due to parts shortages.""

A Lockheed representative said the company is working with the F-35's program office to understand every factor of the cost per flying hour and identify disciplined ways it can reduce the overall operations and sustainment costs of the F-35.

The shortages are expected to plague the fighter jet program for several years the report said. Partly to blame were ""incomplete plans and funding that did not account for the long lead time parts."" In other instances, delays in the establishment of repair capabilities were blamed.

The U.S. Department of Defense is maintaining more than 250 of the advanced F-35 jets and plans to triple the fleet by the end of 2021.

In February, the Pentagon made a deal for a batch of 90 of the fighter aircraft agreeing to pay below $95 million per F-35A model jet for the first time, compared with $102 million in the previous purchase.

The F-35 comes in three configurations: the A-model for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. allies; the B-model, which can handle short take-offs and vertical landings for the Marine Corps and British navy; and the carrier-variant F-35C jets.

Ten other nations including Australia, Denmark, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, South Korea, Britain are also customers.

Lockheed, the prime contractor, and its partners including Northrop Grumman Corp (N: ), United Technologies Corp's (N: ) Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems Plc (L: ) have been working on building a more cost-effective supply chain to fuel the production line in Fort Worth, Texas.

In all, the Pentagon expects to buy 2,457 jets.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lockheeds-f35-fighter-jet-program-has-spare-parts-shortage-gao-548728,0.033,0.922,0.046,0.5965

(Reuters) - Bombardier Inc (TO: ) scaled back CSeries jet deliveries by around a third because of engine delays, but said on Thursday it received its first order for the narrowbodies in 18 months, helping send shares up 4 percent.

Engine delays, which reduced CSeries deliveries from 30 to an expected 20 to 22 this year, are a ""short-term issue"" that supplier Pratt & Whitney is ""actively addressing,"" Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare told analysts.

Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp (N: ), said in October it was resolving issues with the geared turbofan (GTF) engines that power the CSeries and Airbus A320neo to make them more durable.

Bombardier said the delays would raise its free cash flow usage for 2017 to about $1 billion, at the higher end of its forecast range.

Shares were up 4.7 percent in morning trading to C$2.92.

The Canadian plane-and-train-maker also said it received a letter of intent from an unnamed European customer for 31 firm CSeries orders.

European planemaker Airbus SE (PA: ) recently agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries program for $1, in a deal expected to improve CSeries sales and reduce costs.

Bellemare told analysts the Airbus venture, while boosting ""sales momentum"" for the CSeries, isn't directly ""linked"" to the order which the company was already working on and would be valued at about $2.4 billion based on list prices, with an additional 30 options.

Some analysts were anticipating orders because of increased confidence in the CSeries from the Airbus deal, which closes in 2018. A European customer won't face potential duties stemming from a trade dispute with Boeing Co . (N: )

""We'll have to see who the new airline is, but it certainly sounds promising, particularly since it isn’t subject to the US duty,"" said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia.

Bellemare said the company was weighing strategies like forming partnerships to boost volumes of its smaller aerostructures division, which makes components for planes like the CSeries.

Bombardier reported third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes and special items (EBIT) that surged 90 percent to $165 million and a loss in line with analysts' expectations.

It expects full-year EBIT of at least $630 million, which is at the high end of its forecast of $580 million to $630 million.

(Bloomberg) -- Having listened to President Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ rhetoric and his hammering of the need to reduce U.S. trade deficits, what many Chinese executives say they hear is not the threat of a trade war, but the words of a dealmaker who’ll be good for business.

In interviews with more than a dozen executives in Shanghai, Guangzhou and other Chinese cities over the past week, the sentiment expressed repeatedly was a confidence in strong economic ties between the world’s largest economies -- not despite of Trump but because of him.

“He looks at managing a country as similar to doing business, and this is a good thing,"" said Hu Huazhi, founder and chairman of EHang Inc., a drone maker based in southern China. “If America does well, it will pull along other countries more rapidly.”

Behind that optimism is the belief among the executives that a trade war would be too costly for both countries. While having repeatedly bashed China on the campaign trail, Trump has in office softened his rhetoric and walked away from threats to declare the country a currency manipulator and slap heavy tariffs on its goods.

“Even though some people say he has been anti-globalization, in fact he is a pragmatic, realistic person when it comes to protecting his own country’s interests,” said Guangzhou Automobile Group President Feng Xingya, noting that U.S. manufacturers sell far more auto products to China than Chinese manufacturers sell to America. “So establishing a good relationship between our two countries is very beneficial to the U.S.”

If there were a trade war, many of these executives would have much to lose. Drone maker EHang, for example, signed an agreement last year with Silver Spring, Maryland-based Lung Biotechnology to develop machines to transport items for medical use.

Chinese investment into the U.S. reached a record of $46 billion last year. While newly announced Chinese takeovers of U.S. companies has fallen 67 percent this year, that was mainly because Chinese regulators tightened capital controls, according to the New York-based consultancy Rhodium Group.

Midea Group Co. -- the world’s biggest appliance maker, which early this year bought German robot maker Kuka AG for $4 billion -- is another example. It has manufacturing and distribution joint ventures with United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ).’s air-conditioner unit Carrier in Argentina, Brazil and North America. The U.S. company also has a small stake in Midea’s refrigerator business in the Chinese city of Chongqing.

“The scale of our cooperation is getting bigger and bigger every year. UTC’s transactions with us are more than $1 billion every year. If it wasn’t a win-win relationship, it would not have grown so much,” Midea Chairman and CEO Paul Fang said in an interview. “In terms of our bilateral relationship, it’s the same -- if it were not win-win, China and the U.S. would not have such a scale of cooperation.”

Not everyone is as optimistic. A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China found that representatives of about four-fifths of U.S. companies say they feel less welcome than before, citing inconsistent use of regulations and unclear laws as top challenges. Efforts to reach an agreement on a bilateral investment treaty are making slow progress, with too many sectors still closed to foreign investment, said AmCham China Chairman William Zarit.

At the Canton trade fair in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, Sarah Ouyang, a sales representative for an exporter of outdoor sportswear, downplayed the potential impact that U.S. policies could have on China. She noted a September meeting of leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, South Africa and China in the city of Xiamen as an example of how trade ties are being fostered with more countries around the world.

“We have the Chinese government to back us up,” she said.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/what-chinese-ceos-see-in-trump-is-a-dealmaker-not-tradebasher-840656,0.039,0.865,0.096,0.9899

Investing.com – US stocks closed modestly higher on Monday as uncertainty over tax reform continued to weigh on sentiment while a slump in industrials and energy capped gains in the broader market.

The closed higher at 23,451.26. The closed 0.10% higher while the closed at 6757.60, up 0.10%.

In what was a quiet day on the economic calendar, investors continued to be monitor the progress of tax reform as the House of Representatives is expected to vote this week on a major tax reform bill.

Investor expectations of the government pushing through tax reform before year-end have dropped recently as the Senate’s version of the tax bill differs significantly from the GOP’s plan.

Republicans believe that cuts to the corporate tax rate to 35% from 20% should take effect immediately while the Senate proposes a delay until 2019.

President Donald Trump twitted on Monday that he was “proud” of lawmakers for getting “close” to approving a tax bill.

Also weighing on broader market gains was a slump in industrial led by a more than 8% slump in shares of General Electric after the company said it would slash its dividend by 50% as part of its turnaround plan and lowered its guidance on earnings for 2018.

Financials, mostly banks, rebounded from recent lows amid easing fears over a flattening yield curve - long-term interest rates falling more than short-term interest rates or short-term rates increasing more than long-term rates.

Investing.com – US stocks closed lower on Tuesday weighed by a slump in energy on concerns over the strength of global oil demand growth while ongoing uncertainty over US tax reform continued to weigh on sentiment.

The closed 0.13% lower at 23,409.47. The closed 0.23% lower while the closed at 6737.87, down 0.29%.

Energy was one the main sectors weighing on the broader indexes falling more than 1% amid a tumble in oil prices after the EIA revealed a downbeat outlook for oil demand in its monthly report, forecasting weakness in global demand growth, while warning that global oil markets will be oversupplied through the second quarter of 2018.

That added to ongoing negative sentiment as investor doubts grew over the progress of U.S. tax reform as both the House and Senate rush to get their bills passed and into Conference Committee, to allow ample time to produce a compromise bill before the year-end.

The House is expected to vote on its bill by the end of the week while the Senate markup may take until the Thanksgiving recess.

On the economic data front, upbeat wholesale inflation data did little to improve sentiment on US stocks.

The Labor Department said on Tuesday its for final demand increased 0.4% last month. In the 12 months through October, the PPI rose 2.8% after rising 2.6% in September.

The wholesale inflation report came ahead of a consumer inflation report due Wednesday.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus lagged Boeing (NYSE: ) in jet production and sales in the first 11 months of the year but left itself a shot at meeting full-year delivery targets after unblocking delayed engine supplies for its upgraded A320neo jet, company data showed on Wednesday.

The European planemaker handed over 74 jets in November to bring total deliveries in the first 11 months to 591 aircraft.

That included twice as many A320neo-family aircraft as in the same month last year, as Airbus emerges from a two-year bottleneck in the availability of engines for the new model from U.S. supplier Pratt & Whitney (N: ).

November's tally means Airbus needs to roughly repeat a monthly record of 111 deliveries seen in December last year to meet its core target of more than 700 deliveries in 2017.

Airbus in October abandoned an informal goal of 720 jet deliveries that was higher than its official target of 700, but investors have welcomed indications that it is sticking to the underlying goal after resolving supply chain problems.

Airbus shares rose 0.3 percent on Wednesday.

Airbus chief operating officer and planemaking president Fabrice Bregier told French newspaper Les Echos this week that Airbus would deliver more than 700 aircraft in 2017, marking a new production record as engine delivery shortfalls ease.

For new business, Airbus reported 388 orders for the first 11 months, or a net total of 333 after cancellations.

It is seen unlikely to catch up rival Boeing in the 2017 order race but is on course to post more orders than deliveries for the eighth year if it can finalize a record order for 430 jets announced at the Dubai Airshow last month.

Airbus started the year warning the ratio of net orders to deliveries or book-to-bill ratio would fall below 1 in 2017 for the first time since 2009. But it has seen higher-than-expected demand for single-aisle jets, while finding itself outsold more than three to one by Boeing in the contest for wide-body jets.

The two planemakers are now competing to sell 100 single-aisle jets to Delta Air Lines (N: ) and industry sources say some wide-body orders are still potentially up for grabs.

Between Jan. 1 and Nov. 28, Boeing sold 787 aircraft, or 662 after cancellations.

Boeing's November delivery data is not yet available but it is expected to keep its title as the world's largest jetmaker by delivering more than Airbus for the sixth year running in 2017.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/airbus-faces-hectic-december-to-meet-2017-delivery-goal-962122,0.035,0.935,0.031,-0.2023

PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N: ) looked close on Wednesday to placing an order for 100 Airbus (PA: ) A321neo jets in a boost for the European planemaker as it tries to narrow a 2017 order gap against Boeing (N: ), two people familiar with the matter said.

The preliminary selection, first reported by CNN, follows a fierce competition and is subject to approval at a board meeting later on Wednesday, which could still alter or delay the decision, the people said.

Such a deal would be worth $12.7 billion at list prices, but would typically involve steep discounts.

Delta and both planemakers declined comment.

The A321neo has a significant lead in market share over equivalent Boeing narrowbody models, but faces potential competition from a new mid-market jet being studied by Boeing and for which the U.S. firm may start seeking offers next year.

But the endorsement from the second largest U.S. airline by passenger traffic, known as one of the industry's pickiest buyers, brings respite to Airbus after a year marked by a slowdown in sales and internal management tensions.

It is also a boost for United Technologies subsidiary Pratt & Whitney (N: ), which is likely to win an engine contract to power the A321neo aircraft, industry sources said.

Airbus has been in discussions with Pratt & Whitney to ensure that enough engines are available to support the pledge to supply 100 jets to Delta as the U.S. engine maker works through recent industrial problems, they added.

Pratt & Whitney, which competes with French-American venture CFM International to power the A320 family, declined to comment.

Delta's decision to side with Airbus jets over the Boeing model came as no surprise to people in the industry, who have for months watched as tensions continued to escalate between the two U.S.-based companies.

Their relationship began to strain in October when Boeing successfully lobbied the U.S. Commerce Department to propose trade duties of nearly 300 percent on Delta's order of CSeries jets from rival planemaker Canada-based Bombardier Inc.

Boeing had alleged that Bombardier received illegal subsidies from the Canadian government, allowing the planemaker to dump the 75 jets at ""absurdly low"" prices.

""Boeing had a double disadvantage here. Political, over the trade complaint, and technical in that most of the market seems to be preferring the Airbus (model),"" Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/delta-may-place-order-for-100-airbus-a321neo-jets-sources-988764,0.071,0.843,0.086,0.705

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N: ) said on Thursday it will place a firm order for 100 Airbus (PA: ) A321neo jets and an optional order for 100 of the aircraft. Delta, the No. 2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it expects deliveries to begin in the first quarter of 2020, with new aircraft arriving through 2023.

CNN and Reuters reported yesterday that Airbus had beaten out rival Boeing Co (N: ) for the order, boosting Airbus' leading share of the market for narrowbody models, while highlighting the increasingly fraught relationship between Delta and Chicago-based Boeing.

The two U.S. companies' relationship began to fray in October when Boeing successfully lobbied the U.S. Commerce Department to propose trade duties of nearly 300 percent on Delta's order of CSeries jets from Canada's Bombardier Inc.

The carrier declined to say whether the disagreement between the two planemakers had any effect on its decision to go with Airbus.

""This is the right transaction at the right time for our customers, our employees and our shareholders,"" Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a statement.

Delta's decision also gives lift to United Technologies (N: ) subsidiary Pratt & Whitney, which the carrier said had won the contract for the engines that will power the A321neo aircraft.

In the same SEC filing, Delta also said it now expects operating margin of 11 percent for the fourth quarter, compared with the 11 percent to 13 percent it had previously forecast Delta Air Lines' shares were up 2 percent in premarket trading.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - French aero engine maker Safran (PA: ) is set to secure an EU green light for its $7.7 billion bid for aircraft seat maker Zodiac Aerospace (PA: ) to create the world's third-largest aerospace supplier, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday.

Safran has said the deal would boost its position in making smarter and more connected aircraft, targeting planemakers such as Airbus (PA: ) and Boeing (N: ).

The merged entity would compete with U.S companies United Technologies (N: ) and General Electric (N: ).

The European Commission, which is scheduled to rule on the deal by Dec. 21, declined to comment. Safran also declined to comment.

The proposed takeover is one of several deals in the aerospace industry which includes United Technologies Corp's $23 billion plan to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc (N: ).

The Safran, Zodiac tie-up has already been given the regulatory go-ahead in Canada, Kenya, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, the United States and pre-authorized in South Korea.

(Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp (N: ) said that it hit its 2017 target to deliver 66 F-35 fighter jets to the U.S. and its allies last week, despite production problems as the defense contractor built 40 percent more jets this year.

In September and October, the U.S. Defense Department halted shipments of F-35s for 30 days after a production error allowed corrosion to form around fasteners attaching body panels to the airframe.

It was the latest of several production issues that have arisen in the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program.

The F-35 is key for Lockheed, accounting for about a quarter of its total revenue. During the third quarter, sales at Lockheed's aeronautics business increased 14 percent to $4.7 billion, pulled higher by F-35 sales.

""I definitely see growth opportunities for the F-35 program and expect the program to grow much like the F-16 did, as countries look to recapitalize their fighter fleets,"" said Jeff Babione, the head of Lockheed's F-35 program.

The governments of Belgium, Finland, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and others have been eyeing a purchase of the stealthy jet as potential new customers.

In Canada, Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau campaigned in 2015 on a promise not to buy the F-35 fighter, saying it was too expensive.

But last week, in a move that could ultimately benefit Lockheed, Trudeau's government scrapped plans to buy 18 Boeing Co (N: ) Super Hornets and made clear the company would not win a contract for 88 jets unless it dropped a trade challenge against Canadian planemaker Bombardier Inc (TO: ).

The U.S. and its allies are negotiating an annual purchase of a batch of 141 planes. As of Friday, they had more than 265 of the jets already flying.

In order to meet its planned growth to a fleet of more than 3,000 jets worldwide, the company has hired more than 1,300 of a planned 1,800 workers at its Fort Worth, Texas factory. There are also assembly facilities in Japan run by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T: ) and Italy, run by Leonardo (MI: ).

The company is scheduled to deliver about 90 jets next year and the Bethesda, Maryland-based weapons maker aims to nearly triple annual production to more than 160 jets in 2023.

Lockheed shares hit an all-time high of $323.38 on Friday, capping an almost 250 percent run over the last five years and showing that investors expect steady and strong profit growth from the world's biggest defense contractor.

PRODUCTION DELAYS

Despite the consistent growth, the F-35 has been widely criticized for being too expensive, including by U.S. President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials, who have also pointed to numerous production delays and cost overruns.

A quarter of the operating F-35 fleet was temporarily grounded this year because of problems with pilots' oxygen supplies.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office also published a report this year detailing a shortage of spare parts that could plague the F-35 program for several years.

The supply chain is already working at peak capacity.

Lockheed, the prime contractor, and its partners, including Northrop Grumman Corp (N: ), United Technologies Corp's (N: ) Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems Plc (L: ), have been working on building a more cost-effective supply chain.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lockheed-hits-2017-f35-delivery-target-despite-production-hiccups-1002278,0.03,0.866,0.105,0.9904

(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (N: ) will pay $1.06 million to resolve claims that a company it indirectly owned falsely certified the authenticity of counterfeit parts incorporated into U.S. Army helicopter engines, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday.

The civil settlement with the Farmington, Connecticut-based aerospace supplier will resolve claims that a business it has since sold violated the False Claims Act while acting as a subcontractor to Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (L: ).

""Vulnerabilities caused by counterfeit parts will not be tolerated,"" U.S. Attorney John Durham in Connecticut said in a statement.

United Technologies did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The settlement centered on a pump and engine controls systems business that United Technologies came to indirectly own after purchasing aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp in July 2012.

As part of a deal to resolve a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit, United Technologies agreed to divest the pump and engine control systems business. United Technologies sold the business to Triumph Group Inc (N: ) in March 2013.

The department said the Goodrich business had been a subcontractor to Rolls-Royce, an Army contractor, and sold parts to the company to be included in the M-250 series of engines, which were installed in Army helicopters.

From 2005 to 2012, the Goodrich pump and engine control systems business bought, shipped and caused counterfeit microprocessors to be integrated into an engine control unit that was installed in the M-250 engines, Durham's office said.

During that time, the Goodrich business provided to the government numerous false certifications as to the authenticity of the parts, according to the settlement agreement.

Prosecutors have previously brought criminal charges against two men in connection with the case, Jeffrey Krantz and Jeffrey Warga, who they say supplied computer chips to the Goodrich business that were then used in helicopters.

Krantz pleaded guilty to wire fraud and was sentenced in 2015 to three years of probation and a $100,000 fine. Warga pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit wire fraud and was sentenced in 2016 to three years of probation and a $10,000 fine.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/united-technologies-resolves-us-counterfeit-parts-probe-for-1-million-1009947,0.07,0.827,0.103,0.9414

SEOUL (Reuters) - Korean Air Lines Co Ltd (KS: ) said on Wednesday it will receive its first Bombardier Inc (TO: ) C Series jet on Friday after months of delays related to engine issues, with a second delivery to follow shortly after.

United Technologies Corp (N: ) held back some shipments of its troubled Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan jet engines to plane makers, and offered spares to airlines which have had problems with engines already in service.

Korean Air, the first Asian airline to receive the C Series, in August forecast it would receive five CS300 jets this year. In October, President Walter Cho said the estimate had changed to ""hopefully one"".

The first CS300 will be delivered to Korean Air in Canada on Friday and will arrive in Seoul on Dec. 25, with the second due to arrive in Seoul on Jan. 1, a Korean Air spokeswoman said.

Korean Air in a statement said the two jets will run domestic routes from Jan. 16. The airline expects to receive eight more CS300s by the end of 2018, raising its total to 10.

Bombardier, which in October announced plans to sell a controlling stake in the fuel-efficient jet to Airbus SE (PA: ), last week said it expected to deliver 40 C Series aircraft next year.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/korean-air-to-receive-first-bombardier-c-series-jet-on-friday-after-engine-delays-1012244,0.021,0.958,0.021,-0.0516

(Reuters) - Supersonic passenger travel, which died out with the Concorde's demise in 2003, will make a comeback by the mid-2020s if three entrepreneurial U.S.-based companies can make jets quiet and efficient enough to win over buyers and fliers.

Fifteen years ago, Boeing Co (N: ) canceled plans to build the near-supersonic Sonic Cruiser, the last big attempt by a major manufacturer to speed up commercial travel.

Now Japan Airlines Co Ltd (T: ) and Virgin Group are backing one of the three U.S. supersonic projects, Denver-based Boom Technology Inc, which plans a 55-seat all business class jet.

Lockheed Martin Corp (N: ) is partnering with Aerion Corp to develop smaller supersonic business jets, with Spike Aerospace Inc also targeting the private jet market given many see the super-rich as the likeliest early adopters of supersonic travel.

Concorde was developed in the 1960s, meaning this is hardly a new technology. But the program was government-backed, with only 14 jets ever delivered to then-government owned British Airways (L: ) and Air France (PA: ). Other airline orders evaporated as the purchase price soared and they were eventually retired as maintenance costs rose and passenger revenue fell.

New players are relying on venture capital funding models.

""This is more about engines and economics than it is about airframes,"" Richard Aboulafia, the vice president of analysis at aerospace research firm Teal Group, said of the challenges of a supersonic revival.

To make the project economics stack up the engines need to be far more fuel efficient and less noisy than those used by Concorde or fighter jets.

That has proven tough to engineer, especially at higher speeds like the Concorde's Mach 2, which halved the travel time from London to New York to 3.5 hours.

'REALISTIC PROJECT'

Engine manufacturers and jet makers have spent decades improving fuel efficiency, expanding range and reducing noise.

But to get up to mach speed, a supersonic jet requires an engine core more like those on the commercial jets of the 1970s and 1980s which noisily gobble more air and fuel.

""A large fraction of the benefits we have in efficiency and noise reduction we are going to lose as soon as we have to go back to that sort of architecture,"" said Daniel Edgington-Mitchell, an aerospace engineering lecturer at Melbourne's Monash University.

Aerion, the most advanced of the proposed supersonic jet projects, is working with GE Aviation (N: ) to develop an engine based on a core used in F-16 fighters and Boeing 737s that was developed in the 1970s, a GE spokesman said.

In a sign of the challenges involved using an older engine core rather than spending $1 billion-plus to engineer a new one, Aerion has reduced the jet's planned speed from Mach 1.6 to 1.4.

Today's top business jets fly at around Mach 0.9 and commercial jets at Mach 0.85.

Jeff Miller, Aerion's head of marketing, said the speed had fallen to meet noise standards and due to temperature limits involved with adapting an existing engine core.

Aerion, chaired by billionaire businessman Robert Bass, plans for the 12-seat, $120 million jet to make its first test flight in 2023, with entry into service in 2025.

""Aerion has researched the problems since 2003 and therefore reached the highest degree of realism,"" Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said, comparing it to the loftier supersonic ambitions of Boom and Spike. ""If one wants to go faster, a suitable core is harder to find.""

FASTER IS BETTER

Boom wants a $200 million jet capable of Mach 2.2 and Spike aims for a $100 million jet at Mach 1.6, down from an earlier Mach 1.8.

Both want their jets to enter service in 2023, two years earlier than Aerion.

Several industry sources said those timelines appeared unrealistic because the companies have yet to select engines and will face testing and certification challenges.

Boom founder and CEO Blake Scholl said the company was examining an adaptation of an existing engine as well as a clean-sheet option, with more to say next year. Spike CEO Vik Kachoria said his company was in talks with two engine suppliers. Both are working on smaller demonstrator aircraft with different engines designed to prove the concept is achievable within their proposed timeframes.

Engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (L: ) said it was interested in supersonic work. United Technologies Corp's (N: ) Pratt & Whitney division said it was ""not currently"" working with Boom and did not respond to a question on Spike, while GE did not provide comment on either project.

Scholl said airlines need a speed of at least Mach 2 to make the supersonic business case stake up because that would shave one day off a trans-Atlantic itinerary and two days off trans-Pacific trips. For now, only over-water itineraries are under consideration due to widespread bans on civilian supersonic flights over land.

""Faster speeds not only are better for passengers, they are better for airlines, who get to turn the plane around and fly more segments in the same day, possibly even with the same crew,"" Scholl said.

Japan Airlines and Virgin Group, which declined to comment, have a combined 30 options over Boom jets, with three other as-yet-unnamed customers signed on for another 46.

Former British Airways chief Concorde pilot Mike Bannister said the biggest hurdle for Boom was to develop jets at a price that would stack up for airlines, or early orders would evaporate as they had with Concorde.

""The technical challenges, whilst great, are surmountable,"" said Bannister, who was the captain of the last-ever commercial Concorde flight and has advised Boom's team.

""It is an absolute delight to be able to see on the horizon the prospect of another supersonic airliner, particularly for my family because my daughter who is 24 is a commercial pilot. I would love to see my daughter flying it.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sonic-boom-or-bust-dreams-of-superfast-jet-travel-revival-face-headwinds-1022235,0.021,0.897,0.081,0.9961

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions had another strong year in 2017, reaching their third highest annual level since the 2008 financial crisis, as CEOs were emboldened by buoyant markets to pursue transformative deals, even when their targets resisted.

Companies negotiated large deals this year even before they had certainty that U.S. tax reforms advocated by President Donald Trump's Republican party would become law, as economic growth around the world, including in Europe, accelerated.

Setting 2017 apart was the willingness of potential acquirers to approach their targets unsolicited. In some instances, as with chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) Ltd's $103 billion cash-and-stock bid to take over peer Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) Inc, the target companies refused to engage in talks.

""In cases where companies have been sold, close to 80 percent of them were initiated by the buyer approaching the seller as opposed to companies who decided to sell,"" said Michael Carr, global co-head of mergers & acquisitions at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ).

""Some of this is driven by buyers who believe they will not face competition, which encourages them to aggressively pressure their targets confidentially with the implied threat that they will go public,"" Carr added.

Unsolicited takeover approaches helped push global M&A to $3.54 trillion in 2017, roughly in line with last year's $3.59 trillion, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data. The peak M&A year since 2008 was 2015, when M&A totaled $4.22 trillion.

The dealmaking environment has been favorable in the last three years due to the availability of cheap debt financing and high CEO confidence. Geopolitical turmoil, including a potential confrontation over North Korea's nuclear ambitions and faltering negotiations to form a coalition government in Germany, failed to dampen M&A spirits.

""Geopolitical uncertainty has had relatively little impact on our deals pipeline this year,"" said Cyrus Kapadia, vice chairman of investment banking at Lazard Ltd.

""Boards are supportive of deal-making where there is clear strategic rationale, and even in Britain, where Brexit is causing some uncertainty, companies are still pursuing large-scale deals to enhance organic growth,"" he added.

EUROPE, ASIA-PACIFIC M&A UP

A 16 percent year-on-year drop in M&A in the United States to $1.4 trillion was offset on a global basis by a 16 percent rise in M&A in Europe to $856 billion and an 11 percent rise in Asia-Pacific M&A to $912 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Among this year's biggest acquisitions were U.S. drugstore chain operator CVS Health (NYSE: ) Corp's $69 billion agreement to buy health insurer Aetna Inc (NYSE: ); Walt Disney Co's $52 billion deal to buy film and television businesses from Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc; and aerospace supplier United Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp's $30 billion agreement to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc (NYSE: ).

Many of these deals had stock as part of the purchase price, with acquirers emboldened to use their own shares as currency given their high stock market valuations, as opposed to offering just cash.

""We are seeing a stock component becoming a bigger portion of the offers being made, perhaps because the deals are bigger and transformative, and acquirers are looking to offer targets additional upside in these transactions,"" said Stephen Arcano, an M&A partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.

Private equity-backed M&A activity totaled $322.6 billion globally in 2017, a 27 percent increase compared to last year, as more buyout firms sought to put money they have raised from their investors to work.

Dealmakers say the prospect of the U.S. tax overhaul has so far had little influence on deal negotiations.

""If you are an acquirer, you are likely modeling a deal where the synergies and the incremental value of combining is what is driving your purchase price and your premium, not an assumption on the underlying tax rate,"" said Chris Ventresca, global M&A co-head at ‎JPMorgan Chase & Co.

""If you are considering selling the entire company, as long as the buyer is willing to pay your price, you take the certainty of crystallizing a premium now with some ability to participate in tax reform upside via buyer stock,"" Ventresca added.

Companies may decide to allocate more of their cash to M&A in 2018 following the implementation of the U.S. tax changes, however.

""U.S. companies with lots of cash trapped overseas can now more easily put capital to work in the M&A market, while Europeans may try to take advantage of favorable tax policies to do more deals in the United States,"" said Dietrich Becker, co-head of European advisory at Perella Weinberg Partners LP.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ceos-go-ma-hunting-as-booming-markets-unleash-dealmaking-spirits-1039306,0.041,0.882,0.077,0.9806

LONDON (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (PA: ) delivered over 700 aircraft in 2017, breaking company records and meeting its core industrial target for the year, industry sources said.

Exact figures have been kept under wraps ahead of an announcement on January 15, but the sources said Airbus handed over a record monthly total of jets in December, surpassing the previous monthly peak of 111 seen in the closing weeks of 2016.

Coming on top of 591 deliveries posted between January and November last year, that implies deliveries of at least 703 aircraft in 2017 as a whole, up at least 2 percent from 2016.

A spokesman for Airbus declined comment.

Airbus stuck throughout 2017 to an official target of more than 700 deliveries for the year, but abandoned a more ambitious informal goal of more than 720 deliveries in October due to continued delays in engine deliveries for the A320neo family.

Airbus officials have said the delays have now eased, following a two-year wrangle with supplier Pratt & Whitney (N: ) over late engines for the company's fastest-selling jet.

It is the second year in a row that Airbus has been forced to accelerate sharply in December, with that month's deliveries accounting for at least 16 percent of the annual total.

Without disclosing numbers, Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier thanked staff in a memo for ""huge collective efforts"" that had seen the company break records for deliveries logged both in one month and in one year, industry sources said.

Still, insiders said the strong industrial performance would be seen by many as a personal coup for Bregier, weeks before he is due to leave the company after losing a bid to succeed Chief Executive Tom Enders, who is himself leaving in 2019.

Airbus is bracing for more internal changes this year as it emerges from a top-level power struggle and rows over the handling of corruption investigations, but ended 2017 with what appears to be a grand slam performance from its current regime.

Besides ending the year on record output, Airbus is also heading for a record December in new business after soon-to-retire sales chief John Leahy announced the firming up of more than 700 orders, equivalent to a year's production.

Both Leahy and Bregier are leaving Airbus in coming weeks, handing their responsibilities to executives from outside the planemaking inner circle: Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury, who will replace Bregier as head of the planemaking division, and Rolls-Royce (L: ) civil engines head Eric Schulz, who will replace Leahy after he retires later this month.

Airbus will remain in second place on deliveries in 2017 behind the world's largest planemaker, Boeing (N: ), but analysts say the outcome of the order race depends on how many of the new sales make it into the end-year tally of net orders.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/airbus-delivered-over-700-jets-in-2017-met-targetsources-1052798,0.039,0.908,0.053,0.8621

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boeing Co (N: ) said on Tuesday it delivered an industry-record 763 jetliners in 2017, likely beating European rival Airbus SE (PA: ) to retain the title of world's biggest plane maker.

Boeing also booked 912 net new aircraft orders worth $134.8 billion at list prices last year, compared with 668 worth about $94 billion in 2016.

Airbus was on track last month to rack up more than 1,000 gross new orders for the year, excluding cancellations, compared with the 1,053 gross orders Boeing announced on Tuesday.

The tallies confer more than just bragging rights; they show the companies' ability to run factories smoothly, make sales and generate profit.

Boeing shares were up 2.9 percent at $319.16 on Tuesday afternoon. The stock has nearly doubled in the past year.

Industry sources say Airbus, which will report 2017 orders and deliveries on Jan. 15, met its target of delivering more than 700 jetliners, despite problems with Pratt & Whitney (N: ) Geared Turbofan engines.

Airbus' total is still unlikely to match Boeing's. The European firm cut its forecast from more than 720 jets in October due to delays in engine deliveries.

Boeing's orders and deliveries confirmed the plane maker's ability to hit rising production rates. This could mean an additional ""$350 million in revenues versus our forecast,"" said Sheila Kahyaoglu, analyst at Jefferies.

Boeing also said airlines likely will need more aircraft in 2018, keeping production rates rising.

The company expects airlines to boost passenger capacity by 5.5 percent to 6 percent this year, Randy Tinseth, Boeing vice president of marketing, said on a conference call.

With airlines already flying very full airplanes, more aircraft will be needed. ""We're expecting growth to be driven by new deliveries, not by more capability out of the existing fleet,"" he said.

Price targets for Boeing's stock are rising. The median is now $310 a share, up from $293.50 in October. Some targets are as high as $380. Still, 12 analysts rate it a ""hold"" compared with 13 with ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" ratings, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Meanwhile, air cargo traffic is rising, but a sustained gain could arrive too late to rescue Boeing's 747 aircraft.

Boeing has 12 backlogged orders for 747s, about two years' production. Tinseth said air cargo companies are interested.

""The question is when will they be in a position to buy,"" he said. ""They want to make sure that (demand is) sustained.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/boeing-set-to-top-airbus-with-763-jets-in-2017-1081996,0.017,0.905,0.078,0.9715

PARIS (Reuters) - The global business jet market, which had been bruised by the 2007-08 financial crisis, has started to show signs of recovery, the head of France's Dassault Aviation (PA: ) said on Thursday.

Sales of business jets halved from their peak of 1,317 in 2008 to 661 in 2016, according to data from the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, but jet maker Dassault's chairman and CEO Eric Trappier told reporters there were signs the market is picking up and that his company is also in the process of developing a new business jet.

Speaking in his capacity as head of the French Gifas aerospace business interest group, Trappier said there had been a pick up in activity over the past month.

Trappier's comments echoed those made in October by Honeywell (N: ), which said it expected the market to receive a boost from the global economy's steady growth and upgrades to newer aircraft from U.S. companies.

Dassault Aviation last month said it was scrapping development of the Falcon 5X jet because of delays and technical problems with its French-supplied engines. It added that it would launch a new model powered by Pratt & Whitney Canada, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp (N: ).",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/global-business-jet-market-starting-to-recover-dassault-aviation-chief-1090859,0.023,0.921,0.056,0.8608

By Tim Hepher

NANTES, France (Reuters) - Emirates announced a deal for up to 36 Airbus (PA: ) A380 aircraft on Thursday worth as much as $16 billion at list prices, saving the world's biggest passenger jet from death row and securing its future for at least another decade.

The European planemaker said Emirates [EMIRA.UL] had placed a provisional order for 20 of the double-decker superjumbos, with an option for 16 more. Deliveries are due to start in 2020.

The agreement hands a lifeline to the slow-selling aircraft, in service for just 10 years, and rescues one of Europe's most visible industrial symbols overseas.

""The A380 is good to go,"" Emirates President Tim Clark told Reuters.

Airbus shares rose more than 3 percent after the announcement to touch a record high of 92.56 euros.

The deal ends months of tough-fought negotiations. Talks between Airbus and Emirates about a fresh A380 order broke down at the last minute at the Dubai Airshow in November, when the Gulf carrier placed an order for 40 smaller Boeing (N: ) 787s.

Earlier this week, Airbus confirmed a Reuters report that the A380's survival lay with Emirates, saying it would have ""no choice"" but to close production if the Emirates deal fell through despite interest in smaller orders from others.

Emirates and Airbus both said the deal would bring stability to the A380 production line.

The deal marks a final flourish for veteran Airbus sales chief John Leahy, one week before he retires after more than 20 years as the driving force of European aircraft exports.

""Emirates is committing to the program for the long term and plans to take six airplanes a year for 9-10 years,"" the 67-year-old New Yorker told Reuters from onboard an A380 on his way back to France from Dubai.

Calling time on the A380 would not have caused major financial damage to Airbus, but would have been ""emotionally expensive,"" a company source said.

SUPERJUMBO VS TWIN-ENGINES

Leahy said he was now convinced the A380 would be built well into the 2030s.

Sales of the A380 have fallen short of expectation and rival Boeing says the future lies with smaller, twin-engine models like its 777 and Dreamliner that offer more flexibility and are at least as efficient.

But Airbus believes its 544-seat superjumbo still has a role as air traffic rises and airports become ever more congested.

The Emirates deal also means a potential revival for one of the world’s largest aircraft engines, co-produced by General Electric (N: ) and Pratt & Whitney (N: ). Their Engine Alliance venture powers most Emirates A380s, but it has lost out to competitor Rolls-Royce (L: ) on the latest deliveries.

Emirates has, however, appeared unhappy with the performance of the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines. It has invited the two engine makers to compete for the new A380 order, two industry sources said.

Rolls-Royce had no immediate comment. Emirates said it had yet to make a decision on engine supplier.

Emirates' commitment to take six A380s a year for a decade fills a gap in planned production as Airbus touts business from other airlines.

""That provides a base allowing the program to continue so that Airbus can sell two or three planes here, four there,"" Leahy said.

Analysts say Airbus is unlikely to break even on the A380 at such production levels, but that the losses will not make a big impact on the company's accounts, which are dominated by sales of smaller jets worth tens of billions of dollars a year.

Emirates is by far the largest operator of the A380 with 101 in service today and a backlog of 41 superjumbos on order before Thursday's announcement. The last order by another airline for the A380 was in 2015 when Japan's ANA booked three.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/emirates-hands-airbus-a380-superjumbo-lifeline-with-16-billion-order-1119225,0.049,0.9,0.051,-0.388

DUBLIN (Reuters) - CFM International is 4-5 weeks behind schedule in producing its new LEAP jet engine for Airbus and Boeing jets, but remains confident about ramping up output this year.

Company executives said it was also handling queries from planemakers about potential further increases in demand.

The engine maker, co-owned by General Electric (N: ) and France's Safran (PA: ), aims to produce 1,100-1,200 of the fuel-saving engines in 2018 after delivering 459 last year, executives said on a media conference call on Thursday.

CFM, which supplies all engines for the Boeing (N: ) 737 and competes with Pratt & Whitney (N: ) to power the Airbus A320neo, is in the midst of a product changeover while handling higher than expected demand for the older CFM56.

The Cincinnati-based venture is working to catch up on production, but is meanwhile having to address teething issues with the version of the LEAP-1A engine developed for Airbus.

CFM is about half way through overhauling some 70 LEAP-1A engines after quality problems with a turbine disc, announced by Safran last July, executive vice-president Allen Paxson said.

The problem is different from one that disrupted flight tests of the Boeing 737 MAX last year, but the part of the engine involved includes some of the same suppliers, he added.

A further problem with the coating used on a part inside the Airbus version has triggered efforts to allow the engines to stay on the wing for longer before they need to be maintained.

Deliveries of the competing Airbus A320neo family have been delayed mainly by technical problems with the Geared Turbofan engine from Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (N: ), but also by industrial issues at CFM, Airbus says.

CFM had earlier targeted 1,200 deliveries this year, but executives said it was not toning down its assessment of production capabilities or the state of its huge supply chain.

As LEAP engine production cranks up and airlines respond to an unexpectedly strong rise in traffic numbers, CFM has been responding to higher demand for current-generation engines.

Planemakers have meanwhile begun sounding out CFM about pushing single-aisle aircraft production plans higher, beyond their targeted levels of up to 60 aircraft a month each for Airbus and Boeing by 2019.

""We are answering requests of the airframers for information about our ability to support possible higher rates. These are nothing but the standard discussions we have with manufacturers,"" executive vice president Francois Bastin said.

Industry sources say Airbus is evaluating the case for raising A320 production as high as 70 jets a month.

The industry is already accelerating at a record pace on the back of demand led by emerging markets, but engine makers have been particularly wary about overtaxing their suppliers.

Air Lease (N: ) Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy told the Airline Economics conference in Dublin this week that current production plans were ""realistic,"" barring a setback in demand.

CFM said it had received orders for 3,444 engines worth $46 billion at list prices in 2017, including 2,870 LEAP engines.

It has so far won orders or commitments for 14,270 LEAP.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/cfm-says-leap-engine-output-fourfive-weeks-behind-schedule-1152447,0.042,0.902,0.056,0.9103

Investing.com - There's been plenty of debate about the Trump administration's policy on the dollar, but there's no question about the weaker dollar's benefit to the bottom line of U.S. companies.

United Technologies (NYSE: ), 3M and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) have all said more favorable exchange rates contributed to better sales in the fourth quarter.

A weaker dollar makes U.S. products more competitive overseas, where U.S, companies have a major presence.

The dollar has been losing value since its three-year rally peaked in 2016.

The percentage of sales from overseas operations for companies fell to 43.2% in 2016, the lowest since 2003.

Because changes in exchange rates tend to have a delayed impact, the weaker dollar didn't start showing up in corporate profits until the third quarter of 2017.

The energy, materials and technology sectors have the highest percentages of overseas sales. Telecommunications has the lowest. Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) rank one and two in sales abroad.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/weaker-dollar-boosting-corporate-profits-in-fourthquarter-1175047,0.117,0.76,0.123,0.3246

Investing.com – Wall Street closed higher as upbeat earnings from corporates aided the recovery in US stocks from their worst weekly slump in two years ahead of a crucial inflation report.

The closed higher at 24640.45. The closed 0.26% higher, while the closed at 7013.51, up 0.45%.

Investors cheered better-than-estimated earnings from PepsiCo (NASDAQ: ) and Under Armour, with the latter, in particular, revealing a surprisingly positive quarterly performance.

Under Armour Inc C (NYSE: ) reported of $1.36 billion, up 5% from the prior year period, and ahead of the $1.3 billion analysts had forecast.

Financials, mostly banks, also lifted the broader market, as traders awaited a crucial consumer price index update, which could either justify or dent the recent move in US bond yields, potentially triggering an aggressive move in equity markets as was witnessed last week.

Investor expectations for a faster pace of inflation has grown in recent weeks amid bullish CPI data in January and an uptick in wage growth reflected in the nonfarm payrolls report. A softer CPI report on Wednesday, however, could lead many to question whether investor expectations for a faster pace of price increases were premature.

On the corporate earnings front, investors look ahead to an earnings report from, Baidu Inc (NASDAQ: ), HubSpot Inc (NYSE: ) Twilio Inc (NYSE: ), among others after US markets close.

The Dow Jones posted its first three-day winning streak in more than month as the explosive turn in volatility which characterised last week massive selloff faded somewhat as the so-called fear index continued to trickle lower, well below last week’s 50.3 level.

(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Bill Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE: ) Capital Management has exited its bet against nutritional supplement maker Herbalife Ltd (N: ) and has been building a stake in aircraft parts maker United Technologies Corp (N: ), the investor told CNBC on Wednesday.

Ackman said he thought United Tech was a great company, CNBC reported. (http://cnb.cx/2HUollQ)

The company's shares rose as much as 3.4 percent to $138.49.

United Tech's Chief Executive Greg Hayes said last week the company was exploring a breakup of its business portfolio, including jet engines, elevators and air conditioners.

Both United Technologies and Pershing Square declined to comment.

Earlier in the day, Herbalife said it planned to change its corporate name, refinance debt and effect a 2-for-1 stock split to boost shareholder returns, sending its shares up 7 percent to an all-time high.

Ackman's Herbalife move comes after a years-long bitter public spat with the company's management and investor Carl Icahn.

Ever since Ackman took a $1 billion short position against Herbalife in 2012, he has criticized the company as a pyramid scheme, saying its operating model benefits distributors more than the actual users of products.

He expected the company's shares to fall to zero. Instead Herbalife's shares have risen since Ackman made the short bet, forcing him to close that position last year and limit his losses by taking a position in options to sell shares.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ackmans-pershing-square-building-stake-in-united-tech-cnbc-1317437,0.036,0.855,0.109,0.959

By Tim Hepher

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has set a goal of tripling services revenues from its commercial aircraft business to $10 billion within seven years and sharply reducing the number of times its jets are stranded on the ground for technical reasons, industry sources said.

It also targets measures worth 450 million euros ($555 million) in 2018 to improve productivity and has told staff reducing recurring costs on its newest jets - the A320neo and A350 - remains a battle, they said, citing internal postings.

The latest sign of competitive pressures comes as Airbus (PA: ) prepares to announce possible job cuts due to slower production of its largest aircraft - the A380 superjumbo and theA400M military air lifter - at a staff meeting on Wednesday.

Airbus said earlier it would address implications of the slowdown at a works council meeting, but described reports of3,600 jobs cuts or redeployments as ""excessive"".

Like rival Boeing (N: ), Airbus is driving down manufacturing costs while branching into more profitable services, in a bid to emulate the wider margins of third parties who traditionally control the market for repairs and services.

However it has so far given little detailed guidance on targets by business activity.

An Airbus spokesman, in response to a Reuters query, confirmed the $10 billion service revenue target for the main jets division.

He said the company has for some years had a rolling productivity target, but declined to give details. ""Like any leading company ... year-on-year we strive for continuous improvements, unleashing further efficiencies in every business area, strengthening our competitiveness and focusing on our customers,"" the spokesman said.

DIGITAL SERVICES

Chief Executive Tom Enders told analysts last month the total services business across Airbus's jetliner, helicopter, defense and space activities was worth 9-10 billion euros.

He said Airbus mainly aims to improve that through internal growth, striking a different tone from Boeing which has been more explicit about eyeing acquisitions on its way to a goal of more than tripling services revenues to $50 billion by 2027.

""...certainly, we don't exclude other measures but the focus is not on M&A. The focus is on organic growth of the services business,"" Enders told analysts.

Airbus Commercial made up 76 percent of revenue in 2017.

Enders has put emphasis on new digitally based services such as its new Skywise predictive maintenance system, following deals with AirAsia, Asiana Airlines and Etihad Airways.

But while setting its sights on the after market, Airbus has been wrestling with delays and sporadic reliability problems, which it blames partly on engine maker Pratt & Whitney (N: ).

A number of planes have been forced out of service temporarily to switch engines, but the internal targets suggest Airbus is also concerned about quality problems that fall more directly under its control, two industry sources said.

Airbus aims to reduce the number of ""aircraft on ground"" incidents by at least 30 percent over the next two years.

It also aims to cut by 20 percent the amount of time it takes to come up with a fix for a problem when it is identified after a plane has entered service.

Inside its factories, it aims to reduce the amount of costly outstanding or out-of-sequence work and ensure that 85 percent of quality checks known as ""green quality gates"" are successful.

The cost-and-quality drive comes as Airbus accelerates record output to meet demand - a trend that can quickly create headaches if productivity lags behind. Airbus aims to boost deliveries by 11 percent to 800 aircraft in 2018, including 30that it could not hand over last year due to engine problems. Reaching that goal and ensuring over 80 percent of jets are delivered on time is essential, Airbus staff have been told.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-airbus-sets-services-goal-targets-productivity-gains-1325552,0.058,0.839,0.104,0.9854

(Reuters) - General Electric Co (N: ), which was the most valuable publicly traded U.S. industrial conglomerate at the beginning of the year, could sink to the No. 4 spot after a prolonged selloff that has shaken confidence in the company.

Valued at close to $580 billion at the turn of the millennium, GE has dropped to around $125 billion and it was surpassed in value by 3M Co (N: ) in January for the first time since the 1970s.

At one point last week, the gap between GE and fellow U.S. industrial Honeywell International Inc (N: ) was $6 billion, or 5 percent. The difference between GE and United Tech Corp's (N: ) market values fell to $15 billion.

(GRAPHIC: GE Market value - http://reut.rs/2D6JFB5)

Helping to narrow the gap is a 45 percent slide in GE stock over 2017 and a 16 percent fall this year.

Driven in value by a series of investments in several sectors during the 1990s, GE is now paying the price for focusing outside its traditional industrial manufacturing turf, while its rivals have enjoyed a more steady ascent thanks to a sharper focus on their industrial roots.

""All the large-cap diversified industrials like Honeywell, United Technologies and 3M to name a few, have benefited from some of the money that's come out of GE,"" said JPMorgan (NYSE: ) analyst Steve Tusa, who has a five-star rating on Thomson Reuters Eikon for recommendation performance.

""You're really talking about maybe a mid-teens stock at 2020 ... $20 I think is a very long-term target that really isn't in the equation at this point,"" Tusa said of GE's shares, which closed at $14.64 on Monday.

Tusa rates GE's stock ""underweight"" with a price target of $14.

But some analysts are optimistic about GE's stock and future prospects.

William Blair & Co analyst Nicholas Heymann believes that the worse could be over for GE, and its shares are likely to begin stabilizing before moving higher as 2018 progresses.

""I think GE shares have been a bit oversold due to excessive fears about liquidity,"" Heymann wrote in a note.

Heymann cites higher oil prices, improving performance of GE's aviation and healthcare businesses, and the recent nomination of three ""exceptionally talented"" directors to GE's board. He has an ""outperform"" rating on the stock.

GE shares slid even after the company replaced Jeff Immelt as CEO last August with John Flannery. His turnaround plan, which includes cutting jobs, slashing GE's dividend and a possible break-up of the conglomerate, is likely to take a year or more to show results.

When Immelt took over in September 2001, GE was the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company. But during his tenure, which ended July 2017, the stock price fell about 40 percent.

Over Jack Welch's stint as CEO from 1981 to 2001, GE's value rose from $13 billion to several hundred billions of dollars. Welch has since written or co-written bestselling books on management.

(GRAPHIC: GE share performance under three different CEOs - http://reut.rs/2Fh6rfu)

GE's stock trades at roughly 14 times its forecasted earnings, well below the multiples of its peers, as the graphic below shows. The number helps investors gauge the value of a company relative to its earnings.

Saint Paul, Minnesota-based 3M, best known for its Post-it notes and Scotch tape, saw its stock rise nearly 32 percent last year thanks to strong results that helped the company lift its yearly earnings forecast three times.

Honeywell's stock also rose around 32 percent in 2017, as the company sold more aircraft parts and as its energy customers bought more industrial equipment. Its warehouse automation equipment and software benefited from an ecommerce boom.

""We like Honeywell, given a solid management team and exposure to end markets we favor,"" said Richard Grasfeder, a portfolio manager at Boston Private Wealth LLC, which holds about 787,600 shares in GE as of the end of 2017.

United Tech, which sells the Pratt & Whitney jet engines, has a ""significant long-term advantage"" over GE, Grasfeder said.

""We think United Tech could provide learning points for GE management and investors,"" Grasfeder said. ""Good leadership is critical.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ge-value-could-slip-to-lowest-among-large-us-industrials-1329451,0.018,0.839,0.142,0.9983

(Reuters) - Boeing Co (N: ) is doubling down on its landmark new strategy designed to muscle in on the business of maintenance providers by making its next jet the laboratory for in-house services that could radically alter the global business model for selling planes.

Unlike Boeing's last all-new design, the 787 Dreamliner, its proposed new mid-market plane will not bring a flood of revolutionary technical designs to the drawing board.

But it will give the world's largest plane maker a chance to test its new business approach of designing the plane so that it generates lucrative services revenues for Boeing while also offering efficiencies to airlines over the aircraft’s decades-long lifespan.

Along with production costs, the new approach could help Boeing decide whether to invest the $15 billion or more in development needed to build the jet.

""If we decide to launch, it's a big investment and it's an investment that has to contemplate not only the product itself but all of our other strategic objectives,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters.

""So you can imagine we would want to look at this airplane through the lens of lifecycle value as we are growing our services business,"" he said.

Until recently, Boeing and Europe's Airbus (PA: ) sold planes with little involvement in the way they were operated and maintained. Instead, that was work carried out by their own suppliers or third-party shops.

Heavy outsourcing on jets like the 787 expanded the trend by leaving suppliers - such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T: ), which supplies the 787's carbon wings - in command of key components.

While Boeing and others squeezed their balance sheets to launch jets, many of their suppliers used their design influence to forge profitable relationships directly with airlines as they conducted part swaps or repairs required by regulators.

""That seems a little out of balance, doesn't it?"" said Muilenburg, describing how the pendulum is now swinging back to give Boeing more control over parts and therefore the stream of aftermarket services that comes with owning a part's design.

""We do take the majority of the risk in developing new products, and we think that would cause us to want to gain the financial benefit of that risk-taking for the long term,"" he said.

The long-term approach to the new jet is the latest evidence of changes in the $180 billion aero-aftermarket as planemakers jostle with suppliers - and even airlines - for control of repairs, training and data in pursuit of higher margins.

Last year, Boeing centralized services formerly spread across the company in a new division with a goal to more than treble sales to $50 billion in a decade.

The new unit posted operating margins of 15.4 percent last year, compared with 16.1 percent that United Technologies Aerospace Systems (N: ), a major supplier, earned from selling new equipment, services and aftermarket parts.

ENGINEERING DEPTH

The aftermarket is not entirely new to Boeing, and is common in defense, where Muilenburg ran services between 2008 and 2009. Airbus set ambitious internal targets last week and Canada's Bombardier Inc (TO: ) is banking on maintenance.

But after airplane demand peaked since 2014, Boeing has turned more aggressively to parts and services to help meet a target of doubling margins to the mid-teens by 2020. Its core jet margin widened to 9.6 percent last year from 3.4 percent in 2016.

To support the strategy, Boeing is bringing back key in-house technology like avionics - the brains of a modern jet -partly with an eye to future aftermarket revenue.

""It is important that we build out vertical capabilities that sustain our engineering depth...as airplanes become more digital,"" Muilenburg said, adding that broader growth in the industry would also provide a boon to suppliers.

Suppliers say Boeing is also less willing than before to share risks - and profits - with them on the systems they do build. Instead it wants them to build to Boeing's designs rather than leaving them with keys to the all-important aftermarket.

Already, there are signs the mid-market jet could see a swing away from risk-sharing towards straight procurement deals,the head of a major supplier told Reuters.

""It depends on the area of the airplane we are talking about but we are very clear in our intent to grow our services business, and part of that is bringing back inside some engineering and intellectual property,"" Muilenburg commented.

The downside of doing more by itself, suppliers and analysts say, is that Boeing could weaken access to outside innovation, import risk and tie up capital and finite engineering resources.

Depending on how far this goes, industry sources say it may also herald gradual changes in patterns of cash generation.

While planemakers get paid on delivery, engine makers charge little upfront and make money on services provided over years.

Some analysts say new plane manufacturer strategies suggest those business models could start to converge and put pressure on them to be more generous with discounts on jets.

Muilenburg declined to address pricing directly, but acknowledged Boeing's cradle-to-grave services strategy could have some impact on the timing of future income.

""The services business tends to be accretive to margin, but this does give us the flexibility of where we drive margin in the business with the idea of raising the bar overall,"" he said when asked if bundling services could lead to bigger jet discounts.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/new-boeing-jet-to-accelerate-services-shakeup-1338179,0.022,0.89,0.088,0.9966

(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (N: ) Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes is planning to leave following completion of the company's integration with Rockwell Collins Inc (N: ), Bloomberg reported on Monday.

Hayes has discussed a plan with the company's board to leave after the integration, which is expected to take about three years, according to the report. (https://bloom.bg/2ICl4YP)

He could stay as long as five years, depending on the pace of the merger and whether United Tech pursues the breakup it promised to explore later this year, Bloomberg reported.

United Tech, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines, had said last month it was exploring a breakup of its business portfolio, including jet engines, elevators and air conditioners.

The company had struck a $30 billion deal to buy avionics and interiors maker Rockwell Collins last year.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney will soon begin deliveries of spare engines to India's IndiGo airlines, which was forced to ground eight of its Airbus (PA: ) A320neo aircraft last week after engine problems, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

P&W, owned by United Technologies Corp (N: ), will deliver two engines on Wednesday and the remaining within the next 40 days, said the source who did not want to identified.

A series of in-flight engine failures prompted India's aviation regulator to ground 11 aircraft last week fitted with certain P&W engines and operated by IndiGo, the country's biggest carrier by market share, and rival GoAir.

That led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and about a 5 percent fall in the share price of IndiGo's parent, InterGlobe Aviation (NS: ), over the past week.

A string of problems has clouded the rollout of P&W's new engines, with the U.S. aviation regulator warning in February that some engines fitted on the narrow-body A320neo planes posed a shutdown risk.

IndiGo and GoAir have hundreds of A320neo planes on order but they, among other carriers, are facing delivery delays due to problems with the engines.

IndiGo did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment, but said in a statement earlier on Tuesday it had canceled no more than 35 to 45 flights a day, which is around 3 percent of its schedule.

""We are mindful of the inconvenience that some of our customers have had due to the cancellation,"" IndiGo president Aditya Ghosh said in the statement.

""We are actively engaged with the engine manufacturer on getting all our aircraft back in the skies in the coming weeks.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pratt--whitney-to-deliver-spare-a320neo-engines-soon-to-indias-indigo-source-1350078,0.066,0.887,0.046,-0.706

(Reuters) - Billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb's firm Third Point LLC wants to build a stake in United Technologies Corp (N: ),

according to a filing with the Federal Trade Commission, as the U.S. aero parts maker explores a breakup of its businesses.

Loeb's Third Point Offshore Fund Ltd has requested permission from the U.S. consumer protection regulator to acquire shares in the company above a certain threshold, according to the filing dated March 23 on the FTC's website.

Shares of Farmington, Connecticut-based United Tech rose as much as 3.6 percent to $126.73 on Monday.

United Tech declined to comment and Third Point was not immediately available for comment.

United Tech, which makes Otis Elevators, Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines and Carrier air conditioners, in February said it would decide by the end of 2018 whether its businesses were more valuable together or better off as separate entities.

Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes has said if the company were to split, its aerospace business would have about $45 billion to $50 billion in sales, Otis elevators unit about $12 billion to $13 billion, and the climate-control business about $17 billion to $18 billion.

The CEO has indicated that a final review of its businesses was possible after it closes the acquisition of avionics and interiors maker Rockwell Collins Inc (N: ) by the third quarter of 2018.

The company's shares have lagged the broader market under Hayes as the company spent heavily on developing a new fuel-saving geared turbofan aircraft engine and as sales of Otis elevators were pressured by a supply glut in China.

Up to Friday's close, United Tech's shares had fallen about 9.4 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 13.9 percent increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The largest American business lobby group came to the defense of Amazon.com Inc (O: ) on Tuesday after a multi-day Twitter attack by U.S. President Donald Trump that included unsubstantiated criticism of the world's biggest online retailer.

The value of Amazon (O: ) shares held by Jeff Bezos, the online retailer's chief executive and single largest shareholder, had taken a $10 billion hit in the week since Trump began attacking him and his company on Twitter.

Citing an unspecified report, Trump told reporters at the White House that the company was not paying the U.S. Postal Service a fair rate, and that it was costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars and forcing other retailers out of business, and he threatened to raise rates.

Late on Tuesday afternoon, a source familiar with proceedings at the White House said no specific actions addressing Trump's concerns about Amazon were on the table at the White House at this time, but that could change given Trump's dissatisfaction with the company.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobby group in the country, stepped in on Tuesday to defend Amazon, which is a member.

""It’s inappropriate for government officials to use their position to attack an American company,"" Neil Bradley, chief policy officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement, citing the value of the free enterprise system and the rule of law. ""The record is clear: deviating from those processes undermines economic growth and job creation.”

It is not the first time Trump, or another U.S. president, has been publicly critical of a company. Trump has previously criticized automakers, Carrier Corp, which is owned by United Technologies Corp (N: ) and Boeing Co (N: ).

In 2015, then-President Barack Obama criticized office supply company Staples Inc (NASDAQ: ) for not embracing the Affordable Care Act, drawing a quick rebuke from Republicans and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Trump has progressively escalated his criticism of Amazon and Bezos, who also privately owns The Washington Post, which has published stories that have angered the president.

Bezos, ranked by Forbes magazine as the world's richest man with an estimated net worth of $115.6 billion, owns 78.89 million Amazon shares, worth about $110 billion at Tuesday's market close.

Amazon shares closed up 1.5 percent at $1,392.05. The shares started the day higher but fell as low as $1,355.33 after Trump's latest Amazon-related tweet.

Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough tax, taking advantage of the U.S. postal system and putting small retailers out of business, but he has offered no evidence to back up his criticisms.

""The post office is losing billions of dollars ... because it delivers packages for Amazon at a very low rate,"" Trump told reporters on Tuesday. ""If you look at the cost that we're subsidizing, we're giving a subsidy to Amazon.""

Trump offered no details about the report he cited or how he might charge the company more through USPS.

Amazon also ships packages through providers such as FedEx Corp (N: ) and United Parcel Service Inc (N: ) as well as its own experimental shipping service.

Representatives of Amazon and USPS had no comment on Trump's tweet on Tuesday and could not be immediately reached regarding his latest comments to reporters.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/amazon-finishes-higher-despite-trumps-new-threat-on-shipping-rates-1375538,0.092,0.782,0.126,0.9272

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. airline JetBlue Airways Corp (O: ) said on Thursday it has awarded Pratt & Whitney a contract to supply engines for its total fleet of 85 Airbus (PA: ) A320neo aircraft, more than doubling the carrier's previous contract with the engine maker.

Pratt & Whitney is owned by Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp (N: ). Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The new agreement adds 45 aircraft to an earlier arrangement under which Pratt agreed to supply JetBlue with engines for 40 twin-engine jets. The deal also includes 13 spare engines and maintenance of the products.

""Number one was making sure that we had the right engine with the right technology for the future of JetBlue,"" JetBlue Chief Financial Officer Steve Priest said in an interview on Thursday.

Pratt beat out rival General Electric (N: ) for the order, in a boost to the manufacturer after earlier issues with the engine.

Some Pratt A320neo deliveries were halted after problems arose in January, which Pratt had said stemmed from an engineering change it made last summer to the ""knife-edge seal"" in the high-pressure compressor near the rear of the engine.

""There have been some teething issues with the engines that have been well-publicized, but the one thing I will say: the trust that we have with Pratt is fantastic. They have been incredibly transparent about what those issues have been,"" Priest said.

HAMBURG (Reuters) - Emirates [EMIRA.UL] will commit to purchasing options for 16 Airbus (PA: ) A380 jets from a previously announced $16 billion order that handed a lifeline to the slow-selling jet, the airline's president said on Wednesday.

The Middle East airline placed a provisional order for 20 of the double-decker superjumbos in January, which it has since finalised, with an option for 16 more.

""We will exercise them sooner rather than later,"" Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters in Hamburg.

The January order secured the future for world's biggest passenger jets for at least another decade, saving it from being scrapped.

Emirates is the A380s biggest backer, ordering far more than any other customer and making it the flagship of a fleet that has helped transform Dubai into a major international air hub.

The airline is still evaluating which engines it will use to power its new A380s, which are due to be delivered from 2020, Clark said.

The General Electric (N: ) and Pratt & Whitney (N: ) Engine Alliance venture powers most Emirates A380s, but it lost out to competitor Rolls-Royce (L: ) on the latest deliveries.

""There's nothing wrong with Rolls-Royce, but having Engine Alliance come back in again could make life interesting,"" he said.

The airline is short about 100 to 150 pilots, forcing it to reduce the frequency of some routes to Florida in the United States this summer, Clark said. Chinese carriers in particular were offering extremly competitive packages for pilots, he said.

He said the shortage was a short-term situation, adding that Emirates has 170 pilots going through its cadetship programme.

Clark said the past financial year had been better than the previous one in terms of profit. ""The first half was good and we sustained that through the second half so we'll be considerably better than we were last year,"" he said, adding that fuel prices would be a challenge for the current year.

Emirates is ""looking at all sorts of areas"" to work with Etihad Airways after the signing of a security agreement between the two rivals in January, he added without elaborating.

Emirates is owned by Dubai and Etihad is owned by Abu Dhabi, both of which are part of the United Arab Emirates.

ABERDEEN (Reuters) - Scandinavia's largest regional airline said on Thursday it aims to increase its order for E2 jets after it received the first of three new-generation aircraft from Brazil's Embraer to become its inaugural operator.

Wideroe's purchase of Embraer's (SA: ) upgraded E190-E2 marks its first foray into jets after decades linking communities near the Arctic Circle with turboprops. It has options to buy another 12.

""We will work extremely hard to ensure that we can receive the remaining 12,"" Chief Executive Stein Nilsen said during an Aberdeen stopover as the jet was being delivered to Norway.

He said Wideroe could also be interested in the smaller E175-E2, due to enter service in 2021 and currently prevented by union scope clauses from operating in the United States.

The boss of Norway's oldest airline shrugged off a potential offer by British Airways-owner IAG (L: ) for budget carrier Norwegian (OL: ), saying there was no direct competition with Wideroe which serves mainly small domestic airports.

""We are focusing on our niche,"" he told Reuters.

Embraer Commercial Aircraft CEO John Slattery said he sees ""real and advanced"" opportunities for sales as the E2 reaches its first operator, adding he would be disappointed if Embraer only sold as many of the overall family as it delivered in 2018.

The E190-E2 is the first of three new-generation aircraft in Embraer’s commercial jet line-up with new wings and Pratt & Whitney (N: ) engines aimed at improving fuel efficiency.

Embraer is also expanding the size and range of its largest commercial jet, the E195, whose upgraded E2 version enters service in 2019, posing a challenge to Bombardier's CSeries.

Embraer expects a market for 6,400 jets in the 70-130 seat segment over the next 20 years.

""The pipeline of opportunities is as robust as I've seen in seven years at Embraer,"" Slattery said. The Brazilian company has gone through a slow patch in sales of the E2 model.

He declined comment on reports Embraer is close to agreeing the sale of its commercial arm to Boeing (N: ).

EXPANSION PLANS

Wideroe, which once linked rural networks with former owner SAS Scandinavian Airlines and is now run independently under a consortium of investors, plans to introduce the jet on April 24.

It will replace Bombardier (TO: ) Q400 turboprops on some routes and will hold 114 passengers in a single-class layout.

Nilsen said fewer domestic airports and sharp rises of up to 70 percent in airport fees had prompted Wideroe to scale up from smaller despite harsh winter conditions in Norway.

""It has been a real challenge to further the route developments in thee rural areas of Norway,"" he said.

Wideroe however plans to expand international flights and rent out some of the new jets with crews to carry passengers on behalf of Finnair (HE: ).",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/norways-wideroe-says-may-increase-embraer-jet-order-1392472,0.013,0.92,0.067,0.9738

BERLIN (Reuters) - Airbus (PA: ) will not move its existing activities out of Britain when the country leaves the European Union but could forgo basing new projects there, its chief executive said on Tuesday.

""I do not see that we kind of pick up and move somewhere else. But of course for future activities, future production, future development, that is open for discussion,"" Tom Enders told reporters on the sidelines of the Berlin Aviation Summit.

Airbus employs 15,000 people in Britain where it makes all the wings for its commercial aircraft.

The planemaker has previously said it needs to decide whether to spend more on parts in order to build up an extra buffer of stock to cope with potential disruption when Britain leaves the European Union on March 29, 2019.

Asked about Airbus's possible role in a new European fighter jet project, Enders said the group was in ""good discussions"" with other companies that may take part, especially with Dassault (PA: ).

France and Germany are expected to announce initial details about the planned new warplane development program at the ILA Berlin Air Show, which starts on Wednesday, with France's Dassault aiming to take the lead.

Enders said Airbus aimed to avoid the problems seen on the multinational A400M military transport program.

""We never want to come to a situation again where the program is heavily burdened by too many somewhat conflicting requirements or governments telling us which engines or suppliers to take,"" he said.

""That means clear requirements, joint requirements from the customer side, not everybody having 12 different versions,"" he added.

He also stuck with a target for Airbus to deliver 800 aircraft this year, saying he was encouraged by upbeat comments by U.S. manufacturer United Technologies Corp (UTC) (N: ).

UTC's Pratt & Whitney unit halted deliveries of its Geared Turbofan engine for the Airbus A320neo for almost a month this year, but group finance chief Akhil Johri told Reuters on Tuesday that the group expected to meet its full-year target for engine deliveries to Airbus.

""It is no secret that this will be a challenge for the rest of the year, but the positive comments from UTC are certainly an additional encouragement to believe that we can make our guidance,"" Enders said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/airbus-ceo-says-postbrexit-production-shift-open-for-discussion-1411016,0.051,0.884,0.065,0.8104

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp (N: ) is set to win EU approval for the largest aerospace deal in history - a $23 billion bid for avionics maker Rockwell Collins (N: ), people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The deal, announced in September last year, would create a new player in the top echelon of suppliers to Boeing (N: ), Airbus (PA: ), Bombardier (TO: ) and other plane makers.

The takeover would give UTC, maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, more leverage to resist pressure from plane makers seeking price cuts.

Rockwell Collins' software capability would also give UTC an edge in data crunching that allows airlines to spot problems in engines and other components before they fail.

UTC has offered to sell assets to address the European Commission's concerns, the people said, declining to provide details. Analysts had said the deal could face a bumpier road in the EU than in the United States because of the merged company's size and market power.

The EU competition enforcer, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by May 4, and UTC declined to comment.

UTC cleared a hurdle last month after key client Boeing said it had provided consent to the deal after raising initial concerns. Analysts said the combined company could make more than 50 percent of the systems content on a Boeing 787 aircraft by dollar value.

A source close to Airbus had told Reuters it had concerns about the merger. Problems at Pratt & Whitney have delayed European aircraft deliveries, and Airbus has publicly warned UTC to focus on delivering jet engines on time.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-eu-set-to-clear-23-billion-utc-rockwell-collins-deal--sources-1425897,0.048,0.876,0.076,0.8126

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp (N: ) secured conditional EU approval on Friday for its $23 billion bid for avionics maker Rockwell Collins (N: ), the largest aerospace deal in history.

The European Commission said concessions offered by UTC addressed its concerns about the deal, confirming a Reuters report on May 2.

""We can allow this merger to go ahead because in all the markets where we raised concerns, UTC has committed to divest activities covering the entire overlap between the two companies,"" Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

UTC, maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines and various plane components, is hoping the deal will give it more leverage against plane makers negotiating price cuts. Its customers include Boeing (N: ), Airbus (PA: ) and Bombardier (TO: ).",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/utc-gains-eu-antitrust-approval-to-buy-rockwell-collins-1431580,0.009,0.906,0.085,0.9442

WENDY’S CO (O: )

Melvin Capital nearly doubled its stake to 6 million shares.

WYNN RESORTS LTD (O: )

The casino company's chief executive resigned in February following allegations of sexual misconduct.

But Melvin Capital, founded by one of Steven Cohen’s former fund managers, ramped up its position, buying 1.4 million shares to own 2.5 million.

ZIMMER BIOMET HOLDINGS (N: )

The medical device company is considering selling its dental products unit. Healthcor Management added to its position to own 2.3 million shares and Ceredex Value Advisors put on a new position to own 1.6 million shares.

JACK IN THE BOX (O: )

Fast-food chain Jack in the Box, which sold its Qdoba chain to private equity company Apollo Global Management last year, has attracted new attention: activist fund Blue Harbour took a new stake to own 667,000 shares and Jana Partners doubled its stake to own 2.1 million shares. Similarly, Samlyn Capital and Nokota Management took new stakes.

UNITED TECHNOLOGIES (N: )

Daniel Loeb’s Third Point owned 7.1 million shares at the end of the first quarter while Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square (NYSE: ) Capital Management owned 1.9 million shares.

PINNACLE FOODS INC (N: )

The frozen foods company has been pushed by Jana Partners, which owned 5.3 million shares at the end of the quarter, to review operations. Jana has since boosted its stake to 10.8 million shares. Speculation has mounted that a sale or acquisition might be in the offing. Meanwhile, Third Point exited its position, selling 1 million shares.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/hedge-funds-chomped-on-faangs-during-first-quarter-tech-turmoil-1449076,0.008,0.829,0.163,0.9991

HAVANA/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The death toll in one of Cuba's worst air disasters rose to 111 on Monday while Mexico suspended the operations of the Mexican company that had leased the 39-year old Boeing (NYSE: ) 737 to Cuba's flagship airline.

Grettel Landrove, a 23-year old Cuban student who loved to dance flamenco, died in a Havana hospital from ""severe traumatic lesions"", Cuban state-run media reported.

Two Cuban women remained in critical condition due to burns and other trauma, with a high risk of complications, media reports said. Their progress is being closely followed by many Cubans through regular hospital updates.

The airliner crashed shortly after takeoff on a domestic flight from Havana to the eastern city of Holguin on Friday in one of Cuba's worst air disasters.

The accident has killed 100 Cubans, 7 Mexicans, two Argentines and two Sahrawis from a disputed area in the Western Sahara known as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.

The plane was a Boeing 737 built in 1979 and leased to Cuba's flagship carrier Cubana by a little-known Mexican company Damojh.

Mexico's civil aviation authority said on Monday it had temporarily suspended Damojh's operations while it made sure the firm adhered to regulations and gathered information to help investigators find the cause of the crash.

Damojh, which owned three 737s before the accident, has been suspended twice before during regulatory compliance reviews, the authority said.

Operations were halted for about a month in 2010 after a Damojh plane made an emergency landing in the Mexican beach resort of Puerto Vallarta due to a problem with its landing gear.

The authority investigated again in 2013 after receiving a complaint from Marco Aurelio Hernandez, who was identified on the weekend by Mexican media as a former Damojh pilot.

Hernandez was quoted by Mexican newspaper Milenio as criticizing Damojh for a lack of adequate maintenance on its planes.

The 2013 probe led to a suspension for about two months.

Most aircraft accidents take months to investigate. Cuban investigators have so far recovered the cockpit voice recorder and are still looking for the flight data recorder.

Cuba will lead the probe, with the aid of Mexican and U.S. investigators, Cuban state-run media said. It will receive technical assistance from Boeing and Pratt & Whitney, part of U.S.-based industrial group United Technologies (NYSE: ), which manufactured the engines of the plane that crashed.

Friday's crash was the worst in Cuba since a Soviet-built Ilyushin-62M passenger plane came down near Havana in 1989, killing all 126 people on board and another 14 on the ground.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/cuba-plane-crash-death-toll-rises-to-111-as-one-survivor-dies-1456606,0.172,0.782,0.046,-0.997

(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ) said on Wednesday it would invest more than $15 billion for research and development and capacity expansion in the United States over the next five years, spurred by the recent tax cuts.

The company also plans to hire 35,000 people in this period and spend about $75 billion with U.S. suppliers to strengthen local economies.

The maker of Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines said about $9 billion of the investment is expected to go towards research and development, including on artificial intelligence and autonomy.

The remaining $6 billion will be used to increase capacity in existing manufacturing facilities and improve efficiency.

The announcement comes at a time when the company is facing pressures from activist shareholders who believe that a breakup into three businesses could unlock $20 billion in value.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/united-tech-to-invest-15-billion-in-us-over-next-five-years-1459425,0.024,0.849,0.127,0.9545

(Reuters) - Airbus faces an unprecedented challenge in ramping up production to meet 2018 delivery targets following engine delays, and must eventually overhaul a manufacturing system that belongs to a ""bygone age,"" the jetmaker's new president told staff on Friday.

""We have a battle plan in place for this year and the engine manufacturers are working hard to meet their commitments. Still, we know it will be challenging,"" Airbus Commercial Aircraft President Guillaume Faury said in an interview for internal circulation seen by Reuters.

""Delivering 80 to 90 aircraft every month in the second half of the year has never been done before. In the long term we must overhaul a single-aisle production system that belongs to a bygone age when high-rate production of aircraft wasn't needed.""

Airbus has been hit by delays in getting engines from United Technologies (N: ) unit Pratt & Whitney and CFM International, co-owned by Safran (PA: ) and General Electric (N: ).

It delivered 172 aircraft in the first four months of the year, lagging behind the pace needed to hit a full-year goal of 800 even though deliveries traditionally speed up in the final quarter.

Faury was speaking to mark 100 days since taking over the European group's planemaking division from Fabrice Bregier.

Echoing his predecessor, former auto executive Faury signaled a push to exploit digital techniques as Airbus (PA: ) and U.S rival Boeing (NYSE: ) shift towards mass production of jet aircraft that are far ahead of standards previously seen in commercial aerospace.

""Ultimately, we want to move to a position where our aircraft and the manufacturing system are designed as one,"" he said.

Boeing is pioneering a new digital-based manufacturing system for a potential new mid-market jet, which could later be adapted to an eventual successor to the 737, its best-selling single-aisle model. Airbus is however expected to make the leap to the next generation in one step, starting from around 2030.

In a separate interview with French newspaper Les Echos, Faury said no decision had been taken on whether to increase production of the single-aisle A320 to 70 jets a month, compared with the current level of 50 and a target of 60 set for 2019.

Such levels of production are justified by strong demand from airlines, but Airbus is still studying whether its supply chain is strong enough, Faury said. Any step-up in production beyond 60 would happen at the start of the next decade, he added.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/new-airbus-chief-says-challenging-to-meet-delivery-goals-memo-1474184,0.019,0.941,0.04,0.8422

(Reuters) - Planemaker Boeing Co (N: ) will partner with French aerospace firm Safran SA (PA: ) to make and service aircraft auxiliary power units as it uses some its profit from record jet sales to push into other lucrative aerospace segments.

Boeing and rival Airbus SE (PA: ) are branching into more profitable services, in a bid to emulate the wider margins of third party suppliers who traditionally control the market for repairs and services.

Safran already makes APUs, which are used to start aircraft engines and run other systems, and competes with Honeywell International Inc (N: ) and United Technologies Corp (N: ) - the two leading manufacturers of such power units.

""This move will strengthen Boeing's vertical capabilities as we continue to expand our services portfolio and make strategic investments that accelerate our growth plans,"" Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said.

The alliance with Safran comes about a month after the world's biggest planemaker said it would buy aerospace parts company KLX Inc (O: ) to expand its aircraft services business.

The partnership will not affect Safran and Boeing's 2018 forecasts and plans to return cash to their shareholders.

Safran currently supplies a wide range of components to Boeing's commercial and defense programs. It also has a partnership with General Electric Co (N: ) to make LEAP-1B engines for Boeing's 737 MAX.

Boeing has been riding on strong demand for commercial jets, selling a record number of jets in 2017.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Out-of-favor U.S. industrial shares will get a chance to win over investors in the coming days as the companies report quarterly results and address concerns about escalating global trade tensions.

Trade disputes involving the United States and its trading partners, including China, have muddied the economic environment for large industrial manufacturers, which rely on business across the globe.

Investors will be paying close attention to management comments on how tensions may be impacting business.

""There are a lot of companies that have really been hit with these trade talks and that is going to be critical in how they are going to handle it,"" said Alan Lancz, president of investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates.

Second-quarter results pour in starting on Friday with General Electric Co (N: ) and Honeywell International Inc (N: ), and continue next week with Boeing Co (N: ), United Technologies Corp (N: ) and 3M Co (N: ).

Early S&P 500 industrial reports have been strong, with eight of the first nine posting higher-than-expected earnings. Shares of airline United Continental Holdings (N: ) and railroad CSX Corp (O: ) soared on Wednesday following their results.

The sector, which accounts for 9.5 percent of the S&P 500's market value, is expected to have increased earnings by 16.2 percent for the quarter and revenue by 8.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That trails S&P 500 companies overall, which are expected to post a 21.5-percent rise in earnings and an 8.2-percent rise in revenue.

The S&P 500 industrial sector ( ), seen as a reflection of the economy's health, has underperformed the overall S&P 500 ( ) this year, down 2 percent versus a 5 percent rise.

""Trade has really weighed on this sector, especially,"" said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research.

Barclays (LON: ) recently estimated industrials' financial results would be hurt more than twice as much as any other U.S. sector in the event of an escalated trade war with China.

A stronger dollar, which reduces the value of companies' foreign sales, cost concerns, and the lack of a major U.S. infrastructure spending package, also hurt the sector, investors said.

Industrial shares are now cheaper on a price-to-earnings basis, trading at 15.8 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, down from 19.5 times in January, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. That is also a discount versus the S&P 500's 16.5 times valuation.

Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist with Allianz (DE: ) Global Investors, said valuations ""have become more and more attractive in industrials.""

By Sonam Rai and Stephen Nellis

(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (O: ), the world's biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, said on Wednesday it would drop its $44 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors (O: ) after failing to secure regulatory approval from China against a backdrop of widening trade tensions.

Investors expressed relief at the end of the project that has dragged on since 2016, all while Qualcomm fended off a $117 billion takeover bid from Broadcom Inc (O: ), fought in court with Apple Inc (O: ), and faced billions of dollars in fines from antitrust regulators around the world over its licensing practices.

The San Diego chipmaker also delivered surprisingly strong third-quarter results and a rosy outlook for so-called 5G technology, the next generation of wireless data networks. Those numbers, combined with a $30 billion share buyback plan that Qualcomm had promised to implement if the NXP deal fell through, sent its shares up almost 6 percent to $62.95 after the bell.

Qualcomm still faces challenges, including expectations that its chips will not be in the next round of Apple's iPhones and the need to find new markets beyond mobile phones without NXP's help. But it cited progress on one of two major patent royalty conflicts, thought to be with Chinese phonemaker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], in the form of a $700 million interim agreement, $500 million of which was paid this quarter.

The collapse of what would have been the largest-ever merger of two chip companies may discourage other U.S. firms hoping to buy into China's huge developing markets and companies, although technology deals seemed the main concern.

""We obviously got caught up in something that was above us,"" Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said in an interview after the announcement.

""We think moving on, reducing the amount of uncertainty in the business and increasing the focus is the right thing to do with the company.""

Qualcomm needed approval from China, the last of nine global regulators to be consulted, because the country accounted for nearly two-thirds of its revenue last year.

Barring a last-minute reprieve, the chipmaker said in its results release it would make good on a pledge with NXP to call off the merger if it had not won Chinese regulatory approval by 23:59 Eastern U.S. time on Wednesday.

Qualcomm forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $5.1 billion to $5.9 billion, and adjusted earnings of 75 to 85 cents per share. Analysts were expecting forecasts of $5.45 billion and 76 cents respectively, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

NXP Semiconductors shares fell almost 4 percent to $94.50.

TRUMP'S ROLE

Moves by the Trump administration have played an outsized role in Qualcomm's fate, and there had been expectations that the lifting of a ban on U.S. chipmakers doing business with China's ZTE (HK: ) Corp (SZ: ) would clear the way for the NXP deal.

Dealmakers advising on mergers and acquisitions hoped the fallout would be limited to the technology sector in which China is racing for primacy against the United States.

United Technologies Corp (N: ) chief Gregory Hayes said earlier this week that the industrial conglomerate was on track with regulatory approvals to close its $23 billion acquisition of U.S. airplane-parts maker Rockwell Collins Inc (N: ), seeking to quell fears that China could delay its review.

No other major semiconductor deal is pending. Broadcom, whose $117 billion hostile bid for Qualcomm was blocked by the United States in March on national security grounds, says its $19 billion purchase of U.S. software company CA Technologies (O: ) does not require China's blessing.

For Qualcomm, the deal's demise means it will have to focus on expanding beyond making mobile chips.

Qualcomm predicted on Wednesday that Apple would drop the company's chips from its next-generation iPhones in favor of modems from Intel Corp (O: ), the latest sign of fallout from their acrimonious battle over pricing and licensing costs. Qualcomm's revenue projections had already assumed it would gain no new revenue from Apple.

Intel and Apple both declined to comment.

Qualcomm sold $3 billion of chips last year for non-phone use, up 75 percent from two years ago. It has a $5 billion ""backlog"" of chip sales to the automotive industry, in which NXP is also a dominant player, it said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/china-keeps-qualcomm-guessing-on-nxp-fate-as-bid-enters-final-hours-1544014,0.076,0.811,0.114,0.9862

(Reuters) - U.S. companies are putting in place measures to cushion the impact of escalating trade tensions between the United States and China.

The world's two largest economies have already imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other's imports.

In his latest threat to the Asian nation, U.S. President Donald Trump has said he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion worth of Chinese imports.

The following is a list of recent comments made by U.S. companies:

- Caterpillar Inc (N: ) said U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports are expected to increase its material costs by about $100 million to $200 million in the second half of the year. The heavy machinery maker plans to offset most of the higher costs with mid-year price hikes.

- General Electric Co (N: ) estimated that new tariffs on its imports from China could raise its costs by $300 million to $400 million overall, before steps to lessen the impact.

- Detroit automakers General Motors Co (N: ), Ford Motor Co (N: ) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI: ) (N: ) lowered their full-year profit forecasts due to escalating tariffs.

- Boeing Co (N: ) is concerned about the impact of possible trade tariffs on the cost of running its supply chain, but has not yet seen any impact from U.S.-Chinese trade tensions on its business, Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said.

- U.S. industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc (N: ) said it would increase the use of supply chain sources from non-China countries to counter growing costs related to a tariff war between the world's two largest economies.

- Home furnishings chain At Home Group Inc (N: ) said it would make adjustments to its supply chain to mitigate the impact of the proposed tariffs on goods imported from China.

- Home furnishing retailer Pier 1 Imports (N: ) says the company does not expect financial results in fiscal 2019 to be materially affected by proposed tariffs. About 59 percent of the company's fiscal 2019 net sales are expected to be derived from merchandise produced in China.

Of the 59 percent of 2019 sales from Chinese merchandise, about half is expected to have products subject to proposed tariff.

- U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc (N: ) said it expected incremental costs of about $15 million to $20 million for the remainder of the year from the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by Trump. It also says it will take further hits from retaliatory moves from the European Union.

- Polaris Industries Inc (N: ), which makes Indian motorcycles, raised its 2018 cost estimates related to tariffs to $40 million from $7 million, and said it expected to ramp up motorcycle production in Poland for European market in 2019 to offset higher costs.

- Diversified industrial manufacturer 3M Co (N: ) said it expects an impact of about $10 million, or 1 cent per share, on an annualized basis from the tariffs passed so far. The company also said it was prepared to make changes to supply, sourcing and pricing in response to any further tariffs.

- Paper and packaging company International Paper (N: ) Chief Executive Officer Mark Sutton says the company has so far not had any direct impact from tariff disputes.

By Makiko Yamazaki and Yoshiyasu Shida

TOKYO (Reuters) - Daikin Industries, (T: ) the world's largest maker of air conditioning equipment, is turning to Africa for further expansion, 10 years after a successful gamble on sharing its key technology with a Chinese company.

As Japanese manufacturers such as Panasonic stepped back from home appliances over a decade ago to avoid price wars with Asian rivals, Daikin did the opposite, going head-to-head with the likes of South Korea's LG (KS: ).

Fighting off low-cost competitors through local partnerships and acquisitions, Daikin grabbed top share in markets such as India. Africa, where LG and China's Haier are established giants, may seem like another difficult target for Daikin.

But Yoshihiro Mineno, Daikin's senior executive in charge of Asia, said the company is used to silencing critics, recalling the controversy more than 15 years ago over its decision to target mass markets overseas.

""Many skeptics at the time said it would be impossible to make profits in the 'volume zone' in Asia, and that it was pointless to invest there,"" Mineno told Reuters in an interview.

Conventional wisdom, he said, held that the 94-year-old company should focus on high-end markets.

Daikin saw limited potential for growth in that area, however, and executives knew the company would have to focus on low cost and high volume if it wanted to boost its global presence.

The company's market value now exceeds those of electronics conglomerates Panasonic Corp (T: ) and Hitachi Ltd (T: ).

""If advanced technologies or added-value products are your only selling points, your rivals are likely to catch up and overtake you,"" said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at the research arm of Ace Securities.

""But Daikin's business model is backed by cost competitiveness,"" Yasuda added. ""It's among a few Japanese companies that can compete head to head with the Chinese.""

The United States, the world's largest market for air conditioning, has been tougher to crack.

Daikin has struggled to compete with local rivals such as United Technologies' (N: ) Carrier and Johnson Controls' York, which specialize in ducted air conditioning.

Daikin acquired the U.S. company Goodman in 2012 to strengthen its expertise in that area, but has made little headway.

The prospect of tariffs from a trade war between the United States and China adds another headache: Daikin assembles air conditioners in the U.S. using some Chinese-made parts.

Mineno said the company may need to export components from elsewhere in Asia if the trade war escalates.

REGIONAL STRATEGY

In 2006, Daikin took over Malaysian contract manufacturer OYL Industries for $2.1 billion. The deal boosted its purchasing power, and provided access to cheaper global suppliers and nimble product development.

Two years later, it shocked the industry by agreeing to a partnership with major Chinese rival Gree Electric Appliances (SZ: ). The deal gave Daikin mass-market production capabilities in return for access to its advanced inverter technology, which saves electricity by efficiently regulating temperatures.

Critics said the move amounted to self-sabotage because of the potential for such valuable components to be copied.

The technology did end up in air conditioners from other Chinese companies. But Daikin expanded production so quickly with Gree's help that it drove smaller rivals out of the market.

""We effectively created a market for inverter air conditioners with Gree,"" Mineno said.

Gree is still a partner in producing low-end models and components for Daikin, although they compete in most other segments.

""Being the No. 1 player in inverter machines gave us access to government officials and allowed us to influence regulations,"" Mineno said, adding that stricter energy consumption rules, for instance, made Daikin inverters more attractive.

Daikin's sales have tripled since the OYL acquisition, with overseas markets now accounting for 80 percent of its $20 billion annual revenue.

By contrast, other Japanese manufacturers have struggled to maintain their edge in products that include televisions, smartphone screens and semiconductors.

Experts say most failed to innovate enough to continue charging more than their Chinese and Korean rivals, eventually giving up both market share and margins.

INDIA TO AFRICA

Executives said Daikin's biggest growth driver is India, where it has established itself as a top player despite competition from LG, Samsung Electronics (KS: ) and local manufacturers.

It appointed Indian industry veteran Kanwal Jeet Jawa to lead operations there, built a sales network and localized production with low-cost know-how from OYL.

Daikin's market share in room air conditioners in India jumped from less than 2 percent in 2010 to 17 percent over eight years, lifting the company to the top total sales spot of air conditioners for commercial buildings and industrial use.

Jawa will lead the expansion in Africa as well, the company said. It plans to set up a regional office in east Africa in a few months.

Jawa said Daikin would continue to aim for the volume zone.

""It's a very price-sensitive market,"" he said of Africa. ""We want to use our leverage of Indian operations and we want to replicate what we have done in India.""

Daikin is adding production capacity for further global expansion. It opened an assembly plant in Vietnam in May and plans another in Malaysia this year.

It is also considering a new Indian plant to help produce products for Africa, Jawa said.

Daikin has set a 2020 sales target of 90 billion yen ($812.71 million) for Africa and the Middle East, an increase of 11 percent from last year, but Mineno said it may need to revise that upward.

""Globally, I still see a lot of growth potential that can be unleashed by our volume-zone strategy,"" he said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/japans-daikin-thriving-in-asia-and-india-sets-sights-on-africa-1581014,0.044,0.842,0.113,0.997

By Tim Hepher

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA: ) named its second new sales chief in less than a year on Thursday after chief commercial officer Eric Schulz abruptly resigned nine months after being poached from Rolls-Royce (L: ) to lead the battle for jet sales against Boeing (NYSE: ).

The European planemaker said Christian Scherer, head of turboprop maker ATR and an Airbus veteran who had been beaten to the job by Schulz in November last year, would take over the position immediately, reporting to Chief Executive Tom Enders.

Reuters earlier exclusively reported that Schulz was expected to resign. Airbus said his decision had been taken for personal reasons.

The surprise exit comes as Airbus faces delays and industry-wide reliability problems with engines that soured relations with several customers and left the Frenchman increasingly frustrated, people familiar with the matter said.

The company now has a battle on its hands to recapture lost ground after its share of orders against Boeing this year slumped to barely a quarter in the wake of a looser than usual set of commitments at the Farnborough Airshow.

Sources said Scherer's aggressive commercial streak could challenge Boeing's lead in the airplane market, where the two sides are embroiled in a bruising battle for wide-body sales.

But several note he is not a preacher of 'market share' for its own sake, especially where jet market stability is at risk.

TENSIONS

Schulz was picked for the high-profile Airbus post last year after the company bungled efforts to name an internal successor to John Leahy, the U.S.-born sales kingpin who retired in February.

His appointment reflected a desire by the board to bring in outside blood as Airbus endured turmoil over the impact of ongoing UK and French corruption investigations, which severely demoralized the Airbus marketing machine.

But Schulz's previous position as head of Rolls-Royce civil engines did not always guarantee him a sympathetic hearing from airlines currently suffering problems with Rolls engines on Boeing and Airbus jets, according to multiple aircraft market sources.

He was also widely said to have struggled to get a grip on the complex and sometimes faction-ridden Airbus universe.

Nonetheless, his decision came as a complete surprise to top management who were informed this week, insiders said.

Schulz could not be reached for comment.

Sources had also reported a tense relationship between Schulz and Guillaume Faury, head of the planemaking division, who is the leading internal contender to replace Enders in coming months.

""I think (Schulz) understood which way the wind was blowing,"" a person familiar with the company said.

Another person close to the company denied such tensions had triggered Schulz's decision to leave.

A320NEO ARCHITECT

Before joining turboprop affiliate ATR in 2016, Scherer forged the successful A320neo jet program and Airbus's jet manufacturing entry to the U.S. with a plant in Alabama.

The A320neo - an upgrade of Airbus's most-sold jet with fuel-saving engines - generated thousands of orders and powered Airbus shares to record highs, but has been hit by delays in deliveries of engines mainly from Pratt & Whitney (N: ).

In his two years at the helm of ATR, Scherer scored key sales to India and the U.S. but was forced to curb deliveries to Iran after Washington exited an international deal to ease sanctions.

His transfer back to parent Airbus is the second unexpected exit of a French chief at ATR in as many years and could renew pressure for an Italian to occupy the rotating presidency of the firm, co-owned by Airbus and Italy's Leonardo (MI: ).",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-airbus-sales-chief-eric-schulz-expected-to-quit--sources-1609358,0.098,0.847,0.054,-0.9814

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States used an F-35 jet against a Taliban target in Afghanistan earlier on Thursday, marking the first U.S. combat use of the stealthy plane, a U.S. official said.

The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the F-35B jet took off from the USS Essex amphibious assault ship in the Arabian Sea.

The F-35, made by Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) Co, comes in three variants - the F-35A conventional take-off and landing model, the F-35B, a short take-off/vertical landing version, and the F-35C, used aboard aircraft carriers.

In May, Israel became the first country to use the U.S.-made F-35 stealth fighter in combat.

The United States and 10 partner nations are aiming to grow the F-35 fleet to more than 3,000 jets and bring the unit price of the F-35A closer to $80 million in 2020 through efficiencies gained by ordering in larger quantifies.

Lockheed is the prime contractor for the jet. Its partners include Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE: ), United Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp's Pratt & Whitney and BAE Systems (LON: ) Plc.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/lockheed-f35-jet-used-by-us-in-combat-for-first-time-official-1626820,0.044,0.878,0.078,0.743

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Global mergers and acquisitions dropped to $783 billion in the third quarter, down 35 percent from the prior quarter, as the escalating trade dispute between the United States and China cast a shadow on the financial and regulatory prospects of some deals.

U.S. chip maker Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) Inc pulled its planned $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ: ) in July after China delayed offering antitrust clearance, a move seen as retaliatory to the trade tariffs announced by the United States.

This has cast uncertainty on the prospects of other deals involving global companies that require Chinese regulatory approval, including aerospace supplier United Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp's $23 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins Inc (NYSE: ).

""We've got some clouds on the horizon, vis a vis a trade skirmish, or potentially a trade war with China. You have the potential for a hard Brexit and we've got rising rates,"" said Mark Shafir, Citigroup (NYSE: ) Inc's global co-head of M&A.

The number of global announced deals hit its lowest since 2013, at about 9,135, and global deal volume was down 6 percent compared with a year ago. To be sure, dealmaking activity has remained stronger than average and the first nine months of 2018 saw global M&A reach a new record of $3.2 trillion.

M&A activity in Europe has been particularly strong, with deals worth $962.5 billion so far this year, a 72 percent increase compared with a year ago and the strongest period for European dealmaking since 2007.

U.S. M&A, which rose 14 percent year-over-year to $368.1 billion in the quarter, fared better than other regions. Announced deals in Europe fell 14 percent to $151.4 billion, while M&A in Asia-Pacific was down 38 percent to $185.1 billion, the Thomson Reuters data showed.

Among the third quarter's biggest announced deals were chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) Inc's $18 billion acquisition of software maker CA Inc (NASDAQ: ), and Dell Technologies Inc's proposal to pay $21.7 billion in cash and stock to buy back securities related to its stake in software company VMware Inc.

In August, dealmakers had been chasing potentially the largest buyout of all time, after billionaire Elon Musk tweeted that he had the funding secured to take electric car maker, Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: ) private, valuing the company at $72 billion.

Musk had said he had held early talks about the buyout with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, a move that highlighted the growing importance in alternative pools of capital around the world, from sovereign wealth funds to pension funds. Musk decided to scrap the plan and was sued on Thursday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over his tweets.

Hernan Cristerna, co-head of global M&A at JPMorgan (NYSE: ), said he believes companies will gradually shy away from mega deals but remain active in midsize ones, despite the uncertain environment

""Going forward it will be hard to sustain the number of $10 billion-plus deals,"" Cristerna said. ""Next year we will see fewer transformational moves but there will be a large amount of activity in the $3 billion to $5 billion deal range because companies see the logic of doing M&A and are conscious of the difficulties and risks of going through a big transaction.""

Dealmakers said that regulatory risk remains a concern across the globe.

""Antitrust reviews are more difficult to predict,"" said Alexandra Soto, Lazard Ltd's chief operating officer of financial advisory in Europe and globally. ""The traditional definition of markets is changing and entire industries have been disrupted by new technologies.""

Soto said companies remained interested in getting deals done to stay relevant. ""You have to be opportunistic when you operate in a disrupted market and keep on moving rather than standing still,"" she said.

Dealmakers also said they are preparing for an acquisition spree by Japanese companies, following the country's biggest-ever outbound deal this year, Takeda Pharmaceutical's 45.3 billion pounds($59.03 billion)agreement to buy London-listed drugmaker Shire Plc (LON: ). ""Many Japanese companies have access to substantial capital and they are using it to drive M&A growth outside of Japan,"" Morgan Stanley's head of Americas M&A, Tom Miles. ""We expect Japanese companies to continue outbound M&A at a strong pace.""

Tens of billions of dollars in tariffs by the United States and China have not dented the rise of most stock markets in the Western world. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (N: ) Global M&A Co-head Michael Carr said he does not see management teams ""handwringing about tariffs"" when they are trying to figure out whether to do a deal or not.

""Their attention is closer to home, competing to move their companies forward to generate growth for their shareholders,"" Carr said.

Morgan Stanley's Miles said some companies in sectors where tariffs create uncertainty are factoring it into their thinking but added, ""We have not seen uncertainty around tariffs be a major impediment to M&A so far.""

(Reuters) - General Electric Co (N: ) ousted Chief Executive Officer John Flannery in a surprise move on Monday, replacing him with outsider and board member Larry Culp, and said it would take a roughly $23 billion charge to write off goodwill in its power division, primarily from a large 2015 acquisition.

The struggling energy, health and transportation conglomerate also said it would fall short of its forecast for free cash flow and earnings per share for 2018 due to weakness in its power business, something analysts had expected.

GE shares jumped 7 percent to close at $12.09 as investors bet that Culp could re-energize the GE brand and more quickly transform its portfolio. The stock was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 ( ). The shares had more than halved since Flannery, a three-decade GE veteran, became CEO in August 2017 to replace Jeff Immelt, who had led GE since 2001. With a market capitalization below $100 billion as of Friday, GE was worth less than a fifth of its peak value a generation ago.

GE Power's falling profits last year forced GE to slash its overall profit outlook and cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression.

GE's board, meeting in the last few days, unanimously picked Culp as its new CEO. Culp, 55, who was named to GE's board in February, was CEO of industrial equipment supplier Danaher Corp (N: ) from 2000 to 2014, helping grow the company into a broader conglomerate through a series of acquisitions, while also growing earnings.

Some analysts said that GE Power likely missed financial targets for the third quarter, contributing to Flannery’s ouster. GE, scheduled to report results on Oct. 25, declined to comment.

The broad strategies are likely to be similar because the plan laid out by Flannery was made in conjunction with heavy involvement from the board, which included Culp, said Gabelli & Co analyst Justin Bergner.

SHADOW OF ITS FORMER SELF

GE's board was unhappy with the pace of the company's turnaround under Flannery, and when the size of the writedown in the power plant division, which makes electric generating equipment, became apparent, the board was persuaded to seek a new CEO, according to a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations.

However, GE will not be changing its announced breakup plan, which calls for spinning off healthcare and shedding its stake in oil services company Baker Hughes (N: ), the source added.

Culp indicated that he will tackle the company's problems aggressively. ""We will move with urgency. ... We have a lot of work ahead of us to unlock the value of GE,"" he said in a statement.

The troubles in the power plant unit have been intensifying, as Reuters reported in July, with the news that one of its most valuable clients, Saudi Arabia, was lining up competitors to bid against GE for lucrative power plant work.

GE doubled down on fossil fuels in 2015 under Immelt with the $10.3 billion purchase of French group Alstom SA's (PA: ) power business. The deal expanded GE's exposure to gas, coal and nuclear power. It added employees, dozens of factories and service centers at a time when GE was trying to cut costs.

""The board is signaling to the market that we are not going to give anyone free reign like we did with Jeff Immelt,"" said Morningstar analyst Joshua Aguilar.

The power division's outlook appeared to worsen last month when GE said several power plants equipped with its newest turbines had to be shut down because of a part failure.

Changing CEOs ""won't fix short-term problems at power, but Larry, as an outsider, will be able to make the difficult decisions on cost,"" said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research in New York. ""GE is bloated and its culture is destroyed.""

Davis said the stock price has probably already adjusted to expectations of no contribution from power.

A slimmed down General Electric - a 126-year-old conglomerate that was once the most valuable U.S. corporation and a global symbol of American business power -- will focus on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy.

In June, GE lost its spot in the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) after over a century.

""Investors grew impatient with the lack of improvement and with the sheer scale of the problems uncovered. However, these problems were not created under [Flannery's] tenure,"" CFRA analyst Jim Corridore said in a note. ""The market seems to be welcoming a change in leadership but the new CEO will be facing many of the same problems.""

GE said the power division's goodwill balance is about $23 billion and the impairment charge would eliminate most of it. The non-cash charge primarily relates to GE's acquisition of power assets from Alstom in 2015, GE said.

GE's long stock slide means the once-largest U.S. industrial company is now only sixth in terms of market capitalization, behind Boeing Co (N: ), 3M Co (N: ), Honeywell International Inc (N: ), United Technologies Corp (N: ) and others.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - William Ackman said on Tuesday his activist hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE: ) Capital Management LP has built a roughly $900 million position in Starbucks Corp (O: ), betting the world's biggest coffee chain can overcome stagnant sales in its home market.

Ackman's unveiling of a 1.1 percent stake in Starbucks comes as the Seattle-based company is trying to convince investors it can fend off heavy competition from rivals, including fast-food chains and high-end coffee shops. Last month, it announced a reorganization that includes leadership changes and job losses.

While activist shareholders are known to pick fights with chief executives and corporate boards, Ackman sounded a conciliatory tone on Tuesday, as he unveiled Pershing Square's investment at the Grant's Fall 2018 Conference in New York.

Ackman said recent actions by Kevin Johnson, who took over from Howard Schultz as Starbucks CEO last year, were ""encouraging"" and that Starbucks' recent challenges are ""fixable with appropriate management execution."" Schultz stepped down as Starbucks' executive chairman in June.

Ackman praised the re-evaluation of Starbucks' portfolio, the closure of Teavana stores, a rejiggering of its owned and licensed businesses, its cost-cutting initiatives and a $19 billion three-year share buyback program.

""We look forward to maintaining a productive dialogue with Mr. Ackman as we do with all of our shareholders,"" Starbucks said in a statement. Pershing Square declined to comment further.

Starbucks shares rose as much as 5.5 percent on the news and closed 2.1 percent higher at $57.71 on Tuesday. The shares have been flat this year, while the S&P 500 Index ( ) has risen 8 percent.

In his presentation dubbed ""Doppio"" - a reference to a double shot of espresso - Ackman said Starbucks' share price could more than double over the next three years if the company can meet its targets.

Pershing Square built its stake in Starbucks in the last three months, according to people familiar with the matter. It was not immediately clear whether Pershing Square had any discussions with Starbucks prior to unveiling its position.

Ackman has made his name in the activist shareholder world as a passionate advocate of his positions, even breaking down in tears on occasion while defending his bets on companies such as Herbalife Nutrition Ltd (N: ) and Target Corp (N: ).

After three years of losses at Pershing Square, Ackman has adopted a lower profile that appears to be paying off, with his hedge fund up 13.8 percent in the first nine months of the year. The average hedge fund has gained less than 2 percent during the same period.

This is partly thanks to Ackman's managing to turn previous losses into wins. Last year, he lost a bitter proxy contest against payroll processing company Automatic Data Processing Inc (O: ), yet the company's recent strong performance has boosted his portfolio.

Pershing Square, which has $8.4 billion in assets under management, has also unveiled positions this year in Nike Inc (N: ), United Technologies Corp (N: ) and Lowe's Companies Inc (N: ). None of these investments resulted in a public fight, and Pershing Square has already exited Nike.

Historically only one or two of Ackman's roughly one dozen positions develop into the kind of public fights that make headlines, like the short bet against Herbalife or his effort to rescue drug maker Valeant that cost him billions of dollars.

Ackman also has experience in the food retail sector, having invested in McDonald's Corp (N: ) over 10 years ago and in Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (N: ) more recently.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ackmans-pershing-square-unveils-new-position-in-starbucks-sources-1637419,0.042,0.886,0.072,0.9593

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's largest carrier Aegean Airlines (AT: ) picked U.S. engine maker Pratt & Whitney (N: ) to power up to 62 Airbus A320neo aircraft, the carrier said on Monday.

Aegean Airlines reached an agreement with European planemaker Airbus in March for the order of 42 aircraft worth $5 billion (4.36 billion euros) to renew its fleet of single-aisle planes and add capacity for future expansion.

The order was the largest by a Greek carrier and one of the biggest investments by a private Greek company in recent years.

Aegean Airlines said Pratt & Whitney engines would be used for 30 firm, 12 option, and up to 20 leased aircraft.

""We selected the Pratt & Whitney GTF engine to provide our passengers with the newest and most advanced technology available for our new Airbus aircraft,"" said Eftichios Vassilakis, Aegean Airlines' Chairman.

It did not give the value of the order.

Pratt & Whitney, which already powers many of the airline's aircraft, will also provide engine maintenance through a long-term service agreement, Aegean said, without disclosing details.

The agreement with Airbus was part of a fleet expansion and renewal program expected to take place between 2020 and 2025.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/aegean-picks-pratt--whitney-engines-for-its-a320neo-aircraft-1654150,0.009,0.926,0.065,0.9033

(Reuters) - Activist investor William Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE: ) Capital Management has acquired a 3.7 percent stake in hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings, the fund said on Thursday.

Hilton shares hit a more than one year low on Thursday on concerns over a slowdown in the hotel industry against the backdrop of international trade worries.

The activist fund said that the 10.9 million Hilton shares purchased represent about 13.9 percent of the net asset value of Pershing Square Holdings. Hilton has a market capitalization of $19 billion.

Pershing Square, which this month announced a $900 million position in Starbucks (NASDAQ: ), said it intends to discuss the Hilton investment in greater detail in its third-quarter letter and investor call.

Ackman has made his name as a passionate advocate of his investment positions, even breaking down in tears on occasion while defending bets on companies such as Herbalife Nutrition (NYSE: .N) and Target Corp (NYSE: .N).

Pershing Square, which has $8.4 billion in assets under management, has also unveiled positions this year in Nike (NYSE: .N), United Technologies Corp (NYSE: .N) and Lowe’s Companies Inc (LOW.N).",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bill-ackmans-pershing-square-buys-stake-in-hilton-1658915,0.026,0.899,0.075,0.8979

ZHUHAI, China (Reuters) - Russia wants to achieve full independence in its ability to develop civil aircraft in order to avoid being ""pushed around"" by dominant companies and countries in the industry's supply chain, a senior Russian state executive said.

Viktor Kladov, director for international cooperation and regional policy of Russian state conglomerate Rostec, made the comments on the sidelines of China's largest airshow.

Rostec, whose sprawling business includes weapons manufacturer Kalashnikov as well as Russian Helicopters and United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), is among Russian firms that have been affected by sanctions imposed on the country over the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and other factors.

These sanctions have driven Moscow to try and rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms.

UAC last year kickstarted full-scale development of a wide-body jet with China that eventually aims to compete with Boeing (N: ) and Airbus (PA: ) planes. Another Rostec subsidiary is also cooperating with Beijing to build an aero engine.

""Any big nation cannot afford being dependent on others...We are trying to acquire full independence in our capacities,"" Kladov told Reuters, adding he was referring to areas like technology and production capabilities for civil aircraft.

""When you're dependent on just one source of supply, then you're not fully independent; you're reliant. Any monopoly is a wrong thing. When you have a choice, it's a good thing, then nobody can push you around.""

U.S. and European firms currently dominate the aerospace supply chain from engines to avionics and have been heavily involved in Russia's civil aircraft programs.

The Irkut MC-21, a medium-range passenger plane that is being built by another Rostec unit, is powered by engines supplied by United Technologies Corp's (N: ) Pratt & Whitney. The company rolled out the plane for the first time in 2016.

Kladov said the MC-21 was now undergoing certification and that developers hoped it could be fully operational and in service by the end of 2019.

The company also hopes the MC-21 will be able to fly using Russia's self-developed Aviadvigatel PD-14 engine in one year, after the engine recently obtained certification, he added.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/russias-rostec-says-aiming-for-aviation-independence-amid-sanctions-1679398,0.031,0.911,0.058,0.885

BERLIN (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department expects to award Lockheed Martin Corp (N: ) an interim contract for a 12th batch of F-35 fighter jets ""very shortly"" and finalize the deal by next spring, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer Ellen Lord said.

When completed, the deal will mark another step forward for the world's biggest weapons program after years of turmoil, cost overruns and schedule delays.

Belgium last month picked the aircraft over the Eurofighter Typhoon as replacement for its aging F-16s, agreeing a 4 billion euro ($4.5 billion) deal that made it the 12th country to select the F-35..

Negotiations on the U.S. contract are moving quickly on what is expected be the largest order to date for the F-35, Lord told Reuters at a NATO industry conference. She said she expected to wrap up the deal much faster than with the previous tranche, but gave no details on the number of jets or the value of the deal.

Sources familiar with the matter say the deal will cover more than 250 F-35 aircraft for the U.S. military and other allies. The initial placeholder agreement will set a not-to-exceed price that could be as high as $20 billion, but military officials aim to negotiate a price well below that during the coming months, the sources said.

The Pentagon in September wrapped up an $11.5 billion contract with Lockheed for 141 F-35s, lowering the price for the most common version of the stealth jet by 5.4 percent to $89.2 million. Lockheed has said it expects to cut the price of the F-35A to $80 million by 2020.

U.S. President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have criticized the F-35 program for the delays and cost overruns, but the price per jet has declined as production has increased.

Negotiations about the 11th batch of jets dragged on much longer than expected because Trump-appointed Pentagon leadership drilled deep into the costs, people familiar with the talks have said, but Lord said she is determined to complete the current round of negotiations much more quickly.

The contract will also benefit Northrop Grumman Corp (N: ) and Britain's BAE Systems (L: ), which are key suppliers to Lockheed on the aircraft, as well as engine maker Pratt & Whitney, owned by United Technologies Corp (N: ).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp (N: ) has won a preliminary contract valued at up to $22.7 billion to build a batch of 255 F-35 jets for the U.S. military and its allies, the U.S. Defense Department said on Wednesday.

The department said the deal would allow Lockheed to receive $6 billion in funding immediately, a move aimed at preventing major delays in production of the new stealthy fighter jets.

This contract is the first to lock in multiyear commitments from U.S. allies as Lockheed anticipates that buying components in larger quantities will help move the price of the most common F-35 jet to below $80 million by 2020. The most common variation of the jet, the F-35 A, had a price of $89.2 million after the most recent round of contract negotiations announced in September.

Lockheed is developing and building three models of the new warplanes for the U.S. military and 10 other countries that have signed up to buy the jets: Britain, Australia, Italy, Turkey, Norway, the Netherlands, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Belgium.

The Pentagon's chief arms buyer, Ellen Lord, told Reuters on Tuesday that she expected to finalize the interim terms of the deal, known as an ""undefinitized contract action"" or UCA, with Lockheed, its No. 1 supplier, by the spring of next year.

A Lockheed representative said: ""This is a smart approach for the taxpayer, the warfighter and for industry.""

According to the Pentagon, Wednesday's agreement means that U.S. allies buy 149 jets over the three-year period. In the United States' one-year deal, it will buy the remaining 106 jets for delivery beginning in 2020.

The U.S. government will continue to buy jets in annual contracts, but is also purchasing components for future-year jets and will also benefit from the economies of scale allowed under the multiyear contract.

The three-year deal, known as the ""block buy"" among the United States and allies, has been said to be worth more than $37 billion and encompass a record 440 jets.

Wednesday's contract agrees to a high-water mark of $22.7 billion for all of the 255 jets, but that dollar figure is expected to come down during the negotiations while the jet count is considered a minimum commitment.

The interim payment authorized on Wednesday will be deducted from the total contract when the two sides reach a final agreement.

The Pentagon is negotiating a separate contract with Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (N: ), for engines to power the jets.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lockheed-gets-interim-payment-for-first-multiyear-f35-contract-pentagon-1688856,0.016,0.893,0.09,0.9826

PARIS (Reuters) - Safran (PA: ) unveiled ambitions to become the world's leading aerospace supplier in 15 years, overtaking United Technologies (N: ), as it pledged a research and development (R&D) spending drive while increasing cash returns to shareholders.

The French aerospace engine and equipment supplier added that it did not plan major new acquisitions after buying Zodiac Aerospace to become, according to its calculations, the world's second-largest aerospace supplier behind United Technologies.

""The priority will focus on organic development,"" it said in a statement ahead of a capital markets presentation.

The event comes days after conglomerate United Technologies completed its acquisition of Rockwell Collins (NYSE: ) and announced plans to split itself into three by 2020.

Safran, which co-produces engines for narrowbody jets with General Electric (N: ), said it was gearing up for a new cycle of research and development (R&D) partly driven by a new mid-market jet being studied by Boeing (N: ), depending on whether it goes ahead.

It also pledged ""targeted"" R&D efforts at Zodiac and a 30 percent increase in broader research and technology spending as it laid out plans for better propulsion aircraft with more electrics and connected cabins, and wider use of 3D printing.

It predicted like-for-like revenue percentage growth in mid-single digits over 2019-2022 and a recurring operating margin ""trending to a 16-18 percent range"" by 2022 after the engine model switch and the recovery of Zodiac's interiors business.

Safran made a 14.6 percent margin in the first half.

The company plans to invest in more maintenance and repair activities as it relies more heavily on power-by-the-hour contracts for its new 'LEAP' engine, underpinning a forecast of high single-digit growth in civil aftermarket sales in 2018-22.

Safran said it was accelerating the operational recovery of Zodiac Aerospace from the repeated production problems that forced it into Safran's arms earlier this year.

It confirmed a goal of 200 million euros ($228 million) of annual pre-tax cost savings from the merger by 2022 and said ""further upside has been identified"".",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/frances-safran-aims-to-topple-us-rival-as-no1-aerospace-supplier-1704393,0.014,0.939,0.047,0.9022

By Liana B. Baker and Greg Roumeliotis

(Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (O: ) said on Monday it was not looking to revive its abandoned $44 billion acquisition of Dutch peer NXP Semiconductors NV (O: ), a day after the White House said China would reconsider clearing a deal if it was attempted again.

Qualcomm, the world's biggest smartphone-chip maker, walked away from its agreement to buy NXP in July, after failing to secure Chinese regulatory approval. The planned deal was first agreed between the two companies in October 2016.

Qualcomm, headquartered in San Diego, California, and NXP, based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, needed China’s blessing for their deal because of their presence in that country.

After high-stakes talks on Saturday between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Argentina, the White House said in a statement that China was ""open to approving the previously unapproved"" deal for Qualcomm to acquire NXP ""should it again be presented"".

But Qualcomm said there was no prospect for the acquisition to be revived.

""While we were grateful to learn of President Trump and President Xi's comments about Qualcomm's previously proposed acquisition of NXP, the deadline for that transaction has expired, which terminated the contemplated deal,"" a Qualcomm representative said via email.

""Qualcomm considers the matter closed.""

NXP declined to comment.

On Monday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters that President Trump put the issue of the acquisition on the table in the talks with the Chinese president.

Kudlow added that the Chinese president's openness to the deal was a sign of further cooperation on multiple issues, including corporate mergers. Xi's reported comment could embolden some potential acquirers in the semiconductor space to explore transactions, corporate dealmakers said.

""Although that acquisition cannot be resuscitated, Xi’s comment reveals in plain sight that Chinese antitrust policy is inherently politicized,"" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in a blog post.

Qualcomm shares closed up 1.5 percent at $59.14 in New York on Monday, while NXP shares ended up 2.75 percent at $85.67.

Qualcomm and NXP did not lobby for the Trump administration to bring up the abandoned deal in its meeting with Xi and other Chinese officials on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires on Saturday, which was dominated by negotiations over trade tariffs, according to sources close to the companies.

The two companies were surprised to see that the terminated deal resurfaced as an issue, the sources added, requesting anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. Qualcomm was given just an hour’s notice by the Trump administration about Xi's comment on the NXP deal, and its inclusion in the White House statement, according to two of the sources.

The Trump administration had unsuccessfully lobbied the Chinese government earlier this year to give its blessing to the deal.

China's foreign ministry declined to comment on Qualcomm during a regular media briefing on Monday.

Qualcomm had sought to purchase NXP because of its market position as a dominant supplier to the automotive market, as car makers add more chips to vehicles each year. Qualcomm is now focused on developing its own chips for the automotive market, according to one of the sources.

Qualcomm had to pay NXP a $2 billion fee to terminate the deal. To appease its shareholders, Qualcomm has also embarked on a $30 billion stock repurchase plan to return to them most of the money that would have been used for the NXP deal. It has spent more than $20 billion in share buybacks in the last 12 months. NXP has also announced its own $5 billion share buyback program.

DEALS ABANDONED

Several deals by semiconductor companies were put on ice after the Qualcomm/NXP deal fell through, simply because they had a footprint in China and required regulatory approval there. Now, chip companies may be more optimistic about their regulatory chances in China.

One example could be Xilinx Inc (O: ), a U.S. provider of chips used in communications network gear and consumer electronics that has a big presence in China. Xilinx is currently vying to acquire Israeli chip maker Mellanox Technologies Ltd (O: ) after it decided to run an auction to sell itself, according to people familiar with the matter. A successful acquisition of Mellanox could prove an important test of China's appetite to approve such deals. A representative for Xilinx declined to comment. Mellanox did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A more near-term test being watched by dealmakers is KLA-Tencor Corp (O: ) pending acquisition of fellow semiconductor equipment maker, Israel's Orbotech Ltd (O: ). The $3.4 billion deal, announced in March, is still awaiting Chinese regulatory approval. KLA-Tencor's CEO said on the company's last earnings call that he expects the deal to close by year end.

Thus far, other high-profile mergers and acquisitions involving U.S. companies in other sectors have received Chinese approval. Last month, China approved United Technologies Corp's (N: ) $30 billion purchase of aircraft parts maker Rockwell Collins Inc (NYSE: ) and Walt Disney Co's (N: ) $71.3 billion deal to buy most of Twenty-First Century Fox’s (O: ) entertainment assets.

Acquisitions of U.S. companies by Chinese companies, on the other hand, have been few and far between in the last year, after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a government panel that scrutinizes deals for potential national security risks, shot down more of these deals, such as Ant Financial’s plan to acquire U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc (O: ). U.S. lawmakers also passed reforms earlier this year that increased CFIUS' scrutiny of deals.",https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/qualcomm-sees-no-prospect-for-nxp-acquisition-1707824,0.025,0.859,0.115,0.9985

By Stephen Culp

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rebounded on Friday to close at its highest in two weeks after a strong jobs report and assurances from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that the central bank would be patient and flexible in steering the course of interest rates.

In a session emblematic of the elevated volatility that has gripped markets for weeks, all three major U.S. stock indexes surged more than 3 percent in one of the broadest advances in years. The gains more than wiped out the previous session's losses and were led by the technology sector, which bounced back from its largest one-day decline in more than seven years after Apple Inc (O: ) cut it sales outlook.

Since hitting a 20-month low on Christmas Eve just a rounding error from levels considered to be a bear market, the S&P 500 Index ( ) has now gained 7.7 percent. Friday's advance, measured by the number of stocks rising versus those falling, was the broadest in more than eight years.

The main catalysts for the surge were the monthly U.S. payrolls report, which blew past economists' forecasts with the largest number of jobs created in 10 months, and comments by the Fed's Powell.

In remarks to the American Economic Association, Powell soothed market nerves with assurances that the central bank is sensitive to risks that worry investors and is not on a preset path of interest rate hikes.

Speaking after months of volatility in world bond and stock markets, Powell avoided some of the communication missteps that in the past have roiled rather than calmed investors. He also pledged to stay in his post even if asked to quit by President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly chastised the man he put in the job over the Fed's repeated rate hikes.

""(Powell is) saying the right things: that the Fed is prepared to shift, that it's listening carefully, that it's sensitive to the messages the market is sending,"" said James Athey, Senior Investment Manager, Aberdeen Standard Investments, in London. ""It's a good message for the market that is starting to consume itself out of fear.""

Still, others warn that the market's up-and-down roller coaster ride this week could be the new normal.

""While days like today feel good, we still anticipate more economic weakness ahead and expect a continued back-and-forth grind in markets,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

News that China and the United States would hold trade talks in Beijing next week helped tariff-vulnerable industrials lead the Dow's rally, headed by Caterpillar Inc (N: ), United Technologies Corp (N: ), 3M Co (N: ) and Boeing Co (N: ).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) rose 746.94 points, or 3.29 percent, to 23,433.16, the S&P 500 ( ) gained 84.05 points, or 3.43 percent, to 2,531.94 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) added 275.35 points, or 4.26 percent, to 6,738.86.

All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended the session in positive territory, with technology, communications services ( ), materials ( ) and industrial ( ) stocks seeing the largest percentage gains.

Apple shares rose 4.3 percent and led the tech sector's advance as the company began to recover ground lost after warning of a holiday quarter revenue shortfall on Wednesday.

Each of the FAANG momentum stocks, a group that includes Facebook Inc (O: ), Apple, Amazon.com Inc (O: ), Netflix Inc (O: ) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (O: ) were trading higher.

Netflix jumped 9.7 percent after Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) added the streaming service to its ""conviction list.""

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 7.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 6.22-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 5 new highs and 19 new lows.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's air safety watchdog on Thursday directed airlines to make extra checks on their Airbus A320neo aircraft fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines as part of new safety protocols after temporary grounding orders affected the planes last year.

IndiGo, India's biggest carrier by market share, and its low-cost rival GoAir, which fly the A320neos in the country, were forced to ground the aircraft on several occasions due to issues related to the engines.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered that airlines must inspect some parts of the 1100 series engines weekly and train the cabin and cockpit crew to deal with and report any kind of odor, burning smell or smoke.

""Log all the cases detecting odors/smoke in cabin during operation for necessary investigation and rectification,"" the DGCA said in its notification, adding that in all such cases the engine would need to be inspected in detail and used only after the defect is resolved.

IndiGo, owned by InterGlobe Aviation (NS: ), and GoAir did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of office hours. Airbus and Pratt & Whitney were not immediately reachable. The new rules, which are effective immediately, were issued days after a meeting between the civil aviation ministry, the regulator, the two airlines, aircraft manufacturer Airbus (PA: ) and engine maker Pratt & Whitney, owned by United Technologies (N: ) to discuss the issues with the engines.

""During (the) meeting, it was decided to issue directive in addition to the existing measures related to combustion chambers and No. 3 bearing issues for identifying and correcting impending failures of dry face seal,"" the DGCA said.

The notification also said there would be restrictions imposed on the operation of A320neo flights to Port Blair - the capital of India's Andaman and Nicobar islands.

It was not immediately clear whether the regulator planned to restrict all A320neo flights to the islands or only place restrictions on a specific series of the engines that have been found to have issues.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/indian-air-safety-watchdog-orders-extra-checks-on-planes-with-pratt--whitney-engines-1750115,0.046,0.915,0.039,-0.2225

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An IndiGo flight returned to the airport shortly after it took off from the Indian city of Lucknow after the pilot observed ""high vibration"" in one of its engines, the airline said in a statement on Tuesday.

The incident on Monday was the latest to affect IndiGo, India's biggest airline by market share, which operates the largest fleet of Airbus (PA: ) A320neo aircraft fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines.

IndiGo, owned by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (NS: ), and rival GoAir, which also operates the narrow-body A320neos, have been forced to ground the aircraft on several occasions due to issues related to the engines.

India's air safety watchdog last week ordered extra checks on the aircraft as part of new safety protocols.

""The pilot observed high vibration on engine number 2. As a precaution, he returned the aircraft to Lucknow. The aircraft is currently at Lucknow and being inspected by the technical team,"" IndiGo said in a statement.

BOSTON (Reuters) - More investors who typically make passive bets flexed their muscles last year and helped push a total of 922 companies to perform better by improving operations and capital allocation, data from research group Activist Insight show.

The data show that 922 companies were approached last year compared with 856 companies approached in 2017 by investors who had ideas on how management could run the business better or who asked for board seats.

So-called occasional activists were the most pushy last year, contacting 266 companies with public demands, the data show. In 2017 they reached out to 240 companies. These investors are typically passive shareholders who try to protect existing investments by demanding improvements at underperforming companies.

The numbers also show that only 116 companies were contacted by primary focus activists, the large hedge funds that have made their reputations over the years by pushing for change at companies from Allergan (NYSE: ) to Yahoo! (NASDAQ: )

""More entrants into the activism space does limit the options for the big name activists,"" said Josh Black, an analyst at Activist Insight, which tracks activist fund managers and their activities.

Activist Insight worked with law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel to compile its annual review.

To be sure many primary focus activists like Starboard Value, Pershing Square (NYSE: ) Capital Management and Third Point were busy in 2018 targeting companies ranging from Newell Brands to United Technologies (NYSE: ) to Campbell Soup.

But as a group, primary focus activists targeted only 116 companies in 2018 after having reached out to 121 companies in 2017. This made them the least pushy last year, the data show.

And the brand-name activists are still commanding attention from corporate chiefs. Elliott Management, one of the biggest firms to pursue activist strategies, was busier than ever in 2018 and launched 24 new campaigns. And Starboard won 29 seats through negotiated settlements in 2018.

Referring to these types of firms who started 2019 on a busy note, Schulte Roth partner Eleazer Klein said pure play activists will always be around and working. ""These people are not going away.""

And they will raise money even amid poor returns where the average activist hedge fund lost roughly 11 percent last year. ""Fund raising is certainly more challenging especially when firms are not performing. But I don't think these types of firms will have problems.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/growing-field-of-activist-investors-pushes-companies-to-perform-better-1769745,0.029,0.882,0.089,0.9548

By Rajesh Kumar Singh

GARY, Indiana (Reuters) - United States Steel Corporation founded Gary, Indiana in 1906 - naming it after co-founder Elbert Henry Gary - and the city's fortunes have been closely tied to the company ever since.

When the firm started losing business to cheap Asian imports in the 1970s, waves of layoffs followed as Gary became a haven of blight, crime and lost population.

Last year, the city harbored hopes for a revival after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on steel imports and the company planned a $750 million investment to modernize Gary Works, its largest North American plant.

But it's now clear those hopes will not translate into new steel jobs, even after the city and state offered the firm a $47 million tax break package.

The whole point of the investment is to make the plant more efficient, so the incentives will help finance a project that city and company officials concede could ultimately result in job losses, not gains.

Gary's dimmed hopes for a tariff-driven renaissance underscore how the policy has so far provided a windfall for U.S. steel firms but only a marginal benefit to workers and struggling steel towns.

Gary Works once employed more than 25,000 people but now supports only about 4,000 in a city that has seen its population plummet from 175,000 in 1970 to 77,000 today.

Steel industry employment nationwide increased by 1,000 jobs to 83,400 between March, when tariffs where imposed, and November, according to the latest available data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2t8sf4I )

In a statement to Reuters, Trump's Commerce Department called the 1.2 percent increase a ""welcome change from decades of decline and layoffs"" and said ""many more"" jobs would be created as planned industry investments and expansions are completed, without specifying how many.

""Improving efficiency is important and was one of the goals of the tariffs,"" a department spokesman said of the Gary investment. ""We are glad to see the American industry is making investments that will protect their long-term viability and ensure a strong domestic supply.""

The state of Indiana's investment of $10 million in tax credits, along with $2 million in worker training grants, comes with the condition that U.S. Steel retain at least 3,875 jobs at Gary Works. But a state spokesperson declined comment on whether the company could still collect part of the incentives if the number of jobs falls below that threshold.

The city would get no guarantees of job retention for its bigger and longer-term commitment of property tax breaks, a benefit estimated at $35 million over 25 years. The details of both deals are still being finalized, officials said.

U.S. Steel Vice President Douglas Matthews acknowledged the modernization would cut costs and reliance on manual labor. Productivity improvements would likely results in a ""decreasing headcount over time,"" he said.

But without the investment, ""then the business is at risk, and then you put all the jobs at risk,"" Matthews said in an interview.

U.S. Steel declined to comment about why it needed tax breaks to make its investment viable and declined to provide details about its negotiations with the city.

U.S. Steel's 2018 profits shot up to $1.12 billion, from $387 million the previous year. The tariff-driven windfall has allowed the company to spend $300 million buying back its own stock. (GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hqle9h )

Investors remain skeptical of the company's longer-term gains from tariffs, however. Despite recent gains after strong earnings, U.S. Steel's stock is down 51 percent since March 1, when Trump announced he would impose steel tariffs.

That's in part because company's underlying weaknesses remain largely unaddressed: It has among the highest production costs in the world, according to data compiled by Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ). Its revenue per employee pales in comparison with that of rival steelmaker Nucor Corp (NYSE: ). And domestic steel prices, after rising with tariffs, are now drifting down amid rising supplies and slowing demand.

DESPERATE FOR INVESTMENT

Gary officials say the factory investment would bring the city about $1 million in new tax revenue, even after Gary allows the company to pay only half the property taxes associated with the upgrade. That will help close a city budget deficit of $14 million, they say, while giving some assurance that company won't abandon Gary entirely.

The harsh realities of life in Gary make it easier to understand why officials would cut whatever deal they can to keep U.S. Steel. About a third of its citizens live in poverty, and the city has long had among the nation's highest murder rates. A fifth of its homes and half of commercial properties are vacant or abandoned. (GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2S2xH7d )

For Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson, the incentives for U.S. Steel help ensure the city can retain its largest employer and taxpayer while providing an opportunity to re-engage the company in Gary's civic life.

""When you see an investment of this magnitude, then you see that there is a plan for a continued presence here,"" she said.

When the company shut down its coke plant at Gary Works four years ago, laying off hundreds of workers, the city feared the worst for the facility. Around the same time, Gary had watched the company idle most operations at its Granite City steel plant just outside of St. Louis.

Trump's tariffs prompted U.S. Steel to hire back about 800 of those Granite City workers last year after restarting two furnaces there. But there's no such hiring plans for Gary.

City and union leaders here have accepted a lower headcount as a fait accompli. The company has already eliminated 140 maintenance jobs on the west side of the plant since 2015, said Mark Lash, president of United Steelworkers Local 1066, which represents about 1,400 workers at the plant.

The city has had its own layoffs of maintenance workers - shedding 128 of 150 of them between 2006 and 2011. It has been managing with 22 staffers for the past eight years. New spending and hiring are frozen, and city buildings are being sold to raise funds.

LIMITED IMPACT

Public financing of corporate investments is hardly uncommon but is more typically tied to company commitments to create new jobs that boost the local economy.

Gary's deal with U.S. Steel is more like the 2016 deal Indiana cut with United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ) with the help of public pressure on the company from Trump. The firm agreed to retain at least 1,069 workers at its Carrier unit in Indianapolis instead of moving the jobs to Mexico, a deal that also included no new hires.

But the proposed Gary deal is much more expensive: While the state gave $7 million in tax breaks to United Technologies compared to the $47 the city and state have offered U.S. Steel.

Carrier has since laid off about 550 workers in two rounds of cuts, but has said it would maintain 1,100 workers.

Michael Hicks, a professor of Economics at Indiana's Ball State University, has examined the impact of such tax breaks on the state's public finances in the last decade. His study found that state incentives costing about $30,000 per job provided little benefit to Indiana's economy or tax base.

Hicks said the tax deal with U.S. Steel is not so expensive by comparison, costing an estimated $12,129 per job retained.

But it's not a good deal, either, especially given the limited economic impact, Hicks said.

""It is a fifty percent tax cut for U.S. Steel to stay in Gary,"" Hicks said. ""This deal is not going to make people move to the city. This is not going to cause a population growth and employment opportunities.""

(Reuters) - A joint venture of Honeywell International Inc (NYSE: ) and Pratt & Whitney on Tuesday protested the U.S. Army's decision to award General Electric (NYSE: ) Co a $517 million contract for new Black Hawk and Apache (NYSE: ) helicopter engines.

The Advanced Turbine Engine Co (ATEC) joint venture filed the protest with the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), ATEC said in a statement.

""In our review of the evaluation, we clearly offered the best value through a combination of a highly rated and technically superior engine that was judged to be much lower risk, and believe we did so significantly under the government's budget,"" ATEC President Craig Madden said.

The U.S. Department of Defense said on Feb. 1 it had awarded GE a six-year contract to engineer and manufacture the new engines, known as T901, covering thousands of helicopters.

GE said the Army had ""conducted a comprehensive and well-organized (bidding) process with clearly defined requirements and a level playing field for both competitors.""

The company added that it was ""very confident the Army's very thorough review and evaluation of the competing bids will be upheld and that the T901 will prevail.""

By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shake-ups come infrequently for the , but some degree of change may be in the works for the stock index as two of its 30 constituents prepare to transform from large conglomerates into smaller companies.

The latest occasion to re-examine the Dow stems from chemical company DowDuPont Inc, which is breaking up into three publicly listed stocks. The first step, the separation of the company's Dow materials science division, is due to take effect on April 1.

Another index component, industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ), is also in the process of separating into three companies, possibly in about a year.

While many professional investors prefer other stock gauges to the Dow, membership in the blue-chip index - often thought of as Main Street's market barometer - still carries allure because of its relatively few constituents. Funds with billions of dollars under management are also linked to the index, so constituent changes affect flows into and out of stocks.

While pieces of the original components could stay in the Dow, those corporate actions could spur the overseers of the index to add fresh blood, some market watchers say.

""All of the options are certainty on the table,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. ""This could be a catalyst for a new addition to the broader index.""

S&P Dow Jones Indices, which publishes the Dow index, will make an announcement before April 1, according to spokesman Ray McConville.

Any time there is a corporate action in an index, McConville said, ""S&P DJI will review the index and make any necessary changes and issue a public announcement before the transaction takes place.""

Known for its inclusion of large U.S. companies as well as its relatively few members compared to other barometers, the Dow has changed components roughly every two years over the past 20 years. The most recent such move came last June, when longtime member General Electric (NYSE: ) Co was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) Inc.

Prior to that, DowDupont took over for DuPont (NYSE: ) in September 2017, after the latter company merged with Dow Chemical (NYSE: ), and Apple (NASDAQ: ) replaced AT&T (NYSE: ) in March 2015.

The index is a measure of 30 companies designed to provide suitable sector representation, except for transportation and utilities stocks, which are covered by other Dow Jones indexes, according to published methodology for the index.

The overall level of the Dow does not change when its components do, because the divisor used to calculate the index is adjusted.

Stock selection is ""not governed by"" quantitative rules, according to the published methodology, which also says ""a stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors.""

The subjectivity of the criteria regularly prompts speculation about which companies may qualify.

Some companies that seem like obvious candidates at first blush may have strikes against them. For example, two of the largest U.S. companies - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc, the parent of Google - have share prices that are both well over $1,000 each.

That's a problem because such high prices would warp the Dow, whose constituents carry more weight the higher their share price. At about $375 a share, Boeing (NYSE: ) Co is the highest priced stock in the Dow by more than $100.

Many indexes, such as the , are weighted by companies' market capitalization, rather than by their share price.

One remaining piece of DowDuPont - the only materials sector stock in the Dow - could stay in the Dow Jones index.

""If you take DowDuPont off, then there is nothing really with that materials"" exposure, said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson in Seattle. ""I am not sure this is an opportunity to make a big change here.""

The DowDuPont breakup will leave Dow, specialty products company DuPont and Corteva, which focuses on agriculture.

Dow and DuPont would be the biggest of the three, with market values estimated at about $50 billion and $60 billion, respectively, according to Nomura Instinet analyst Aleksey Yefremov. ""If they want to have a materials company they have to pick one of these two, just because they are so broad,” Yefremov said.

United Tech is separating into an aerospace supplier, an elevator manufacturer, and a provider of building products including air-conditioning systems.

Aerospace is by far the biggest division of the three by sales, but with one aerospace stock already in the Dow - planemaker Boeing - that new company may be redundant.

In many investors' eyes, the Dow pales in importance as a market barometer to the S&P 500, with its 500 constituents weighted by market value. Just over $23 billion is invested in mutual and exchange-traded funds tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average compared to nearly $4.3 trillion tied to the S&P 500, according to Lipper research.

But the more than 120-year-old index remains a popular market gauge.

""The Dow’s price-weighted construct and the fact that it’s only 30 names makes it reasonably distinct from measures that folks will more likely look at to be representing the market as a whole,"" said Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares, which has five ETFs with $1.5 billion linked to the Dow.

But, adds Hyman: ""The fact that it’s distinct means that some folks will find utility in it.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-corporate-breakups-could-be-catalyst-to-change-dow-index-1815027,0.01,0.918,0.072,0.9963

Investing.com - The U.S. first-quarter earnings season has gotten off to a strong start so far. According to FactSet, more than 78% of the companies that have reported until now have topped analyst expectations, easing worries of an earnings recession.

That has helped keep the S&P 500 near its all-time high reached in September.

Next week marks one of the busiest weeks of the first-quarter earnings season on Wall Street, with many of the big-name U.S. technology stocks, such as Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Intel (NASDAQ: ), set to report.

Other high-profile names set to report next week include, Boeing (NYSE: ), Caterpillar (NYSE: ), 3M (NYSE: ), United Technologies (NYSE: ), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ), Verizon (NYSE: ), AT&T (NYSE: ), Comcast (NASDAQ: ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), Starbucks (NASDAQ: ), Twitter (NYSE: ), Snap (NYSE: ), eBay (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Ford (NYSE: ), Visa (NYSE: ), United Parcel Service (NYSE: ), American Airlines (NASDAQ: ), Exxon (NYSE: ), and Chevron (NYSE: ).

Some of the big names that reported this week, included Netflix (NASDAQ: ), which gave a weak forecast that unnerved investors, although the company's quarterly results beat Wall Street targets.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) also posted results, which showed revenue declines across nearly all its main businesses.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The and the Nasdaq registered record closing highs after a broadbased rally on Tuesday, as a clutch of better-than-expected earnings reports eased concerns about a slowdown.

In Tuesday's trading the benchmark index finally erased all the steep losses it saw in late 2018 by ending the day above the previous record reached on Sept. 20. It closed just 0.3% below its intra-day record of 2,940.91 hit on Sept. 21.

The S&P has risen 17 percent so far this year, with help from a dovish Federal Reserve and hopes of a U.S.-China trade resolution as well as the upbeat start to the first-quarter earnings season.

""Part of what's pushing the S&P up is a general belief it will make a new high,"" said Rick Meckler of Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey, who expects that more earnings reports later in the week could push the index above its all-time high.

The diversity of industry sectors reporting strong results on Tuesday gave further reassurance to Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Delaware, who expects the trend to continue.

""Today was a very broadly representative day of the overall economy. That's what's driving the markets,"" said Roth citing results from United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ), Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: ) Co.

""If the earnings season is as strong as we expect the next major signpost is the trade situation with China and getting that resolved,"" said Roth.

The rose 145.34 points, or 0.55%, to 26,656.39, the S&P 500 gained 25.71 points, or 0.88%, to 2,933.68 and the added 105.56 points, or 1.32%, to 8,120.82.

Profits of S&P 500 companies are still expected to decline 1.3% in the first quarter, in what analysts say could be the first earnings contraction since 2016. However, forecasts have largely improved since the start of April.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ), set to report results later this week, gained 2.2%, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.

Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with a rebound in healthcare, which gained 1.6%, providing the biggest boost. The healthcare sector has been slammed with 6.7% drop in the last two weeks on U.S. policy concerns.

""People just realized (healthcare) got beaten so far down it might be worth taking a chance,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.

The consumer staples sector was the only S&P sector that ended the day lower as investors favored riskier bets. The energy and utilities sectors were the next weakest performers on the day.

Twitter Inc (NYSE: ) shares soared 15.6% after the social media company posted better-than-expected quarterly revenue and a surprise increase in monthly active users.

Hasbro Inc (NASDAQ: ) rose 14.2% after the toymaker reported a surprise quarterly profit.

Coca-Cola rose 1.7% after its quarterly sales beat estimates, helped in part by strong demand for Coke Zero.

Lockheed Martin jumped 5.7% after it reported upbeat quarterly results and lifted its full-year profit forecast on strong demand for its missiles and fighter jets.

United Technologies rose 2.3% after it raised its full-year profit forecast.

Procter & Gamble Co fell 2.6% and was the biggest drag on the market after reporting a decline in its third-quarter operating margin.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.91-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.82-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 45 new lows.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE: ) Co learned that a cockpit warning light on its 737 MAX jetliner was defective in 2017 but decided to defer fixing it until 2020, U.S. lawmakers said on Friday.

The defective warning light alerts pilots when two sensors that measure the angle between the airflow and the wing disagree. Faulty ""angle of attack"" data is suspected of playing a role in two deadly crashes involving Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia in March.

Those crashes, which killed 346 people, have triggered investigations by aviation regulators and U.S. lawmakers and left Chicago-based Boeing facing one of the biggest crises in its more than 100-year history.

Boeing decided in November 2017 to defer a software update to correct the so-called AOA Disagree alert defect until 2020, three years after discovering the flaw, U.S. Congressmen Peter DeFazio and Rick Larsen said in a press release on Friday. Boeing only accelerated this schedule after the Lion Air accident in Indonesia, they added.

Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said by email that a company safety review found the absence of the AOA Disagree alert did not adversely impact airplane safety or operation.

""Based on the safety review, the update was scheduled for the MAX 10 entry into service in 2020,"" Johndroe said. ""We fell short in the implementation of the AoA Disagree alert and are taking steps to address these issues so they do not occur again.""

Boeing has said it discovered the problem in 2017, soon after it began delivering its top-selling 737 MAX aircraft to customers. But it did not inform the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about the defect until after the Lion Air crash more than one year later, the lawmakers said.

The House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure sent letters to Boeing, supplier United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ) and the FAA requesting further details on the AoA Disagree alert, the lawmakers said.

The letter was the second such records request sent by the committee to Boeing and the FAA related to its investigation into the MAX aircraft.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/boeing-delayed-fix-of-defective-737-max-warning-light-for-three-years-us-lawmakers-1891981,0.146,0.788,0.066,-0.9893

(Reuters) - Shares of defense contractor Raytheon (NYSE: ) Co and United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ) pared gains on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was a ""little concerned"" about their $121 billion merger to create a new aero-defense company.

Trump said the merger would harm competition and make it more difficult for the U.S. government to negotiate defense contracts.

""I want to see that we don't hurt our competition,"" he said in an interview with CNBC.

The surprise deal, announced on Sunday, will create the world's second largest aero-and-defense company by sales behind Boeing (NYSE: ) Co and allow Raytheon to expand into commercial aviation while reducing United Technologies' dependence on aerospace.

""The proposed UTX-RTN merger looks like a good, but not transformative, fit with solid financials and modest regulatory risk. Investors should like the deal for RTN and may be neutral to slightly positive for UTX,"" Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr said in a note.

The two companies have some common customers, but have argued that their business overlap is limited as they face the prospect of U.S. antitrust regulators scrutiny.

Dismissing concerns over the antitrust scrutiny, United Technologies said it expects to secure approvals by early 2020.

""The RTN-UTX merger is a surprise but we see real rationales on both sides in scale, diversification in the face of cyclical uncertainty, and financial benefits,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a note.

""UTX also gets to de-lever with Raytheon's balance sheet and Raytheon holders get compensated in return.""

Under the deal, Raytheon shareholders will receive 2.3348 shares in the new company Raytheon Technologies for each Raytheon share and the new company will assume about $26 billion in net debt.

United Tech's shares were down about 2% at $129.40, while Raytheon's stock was up 1.7% at $189.2 in morning trade.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/united-technologies-raytheon-both-gain-on-121-billion-merger-1893082,0.056,0.783,0.16,0.9809

By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended near flat and the Dow snapped a six-day winning streak on Tuesday, as investors paused following a run of gains and fresh worries emerged over the U.S. trade war with China.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was holding up a trade deal with China and had no interest in moving ahead, unless Beijing agrees to four or five ""major points"" which he did not specify.

Separately, Trump said he would impose more tariffs on Chinese imports if there was no progress in talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit later this month.

Stocks were mostly higher in early trading amid lingering optimism over Trump's decision late on Friday to hold off import tariffs on Mexico.

""Trade sentiment is driving everything,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.

""What we're seeing today is the more pessimistic view on what might happen by the end of the month. Most selling in the month of May could be put down to China and Mexico.""

Investors also may be reluctant to push stocks higher without a fresh catalyst for support, some strategists said.

Data showed U.S. producer prices increased solidly for a second straight month in May, in line with expectations of economists polled by Reuters, pointing to a steady pickup in underlying inflation pressures.

Industrials and utilities indexes led the way lower Tuesday, with the industrial index falling 0.9%, weighed down by losses in United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ) and Raytheon (NYSE: ) Co.

The fell 14.17 points, or 0.05%, to 26,048.51, the S&P 500 lost 1.01 points, or 0.03%, to 2,885.72 and the dropped 0.60 points, or 0.01%, to 7,822.57.

Recent optimism over trade tensions and the prospect of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve had helped stocks rally in recent sessions. The benchmark S&P 500 is just 2% away from its early May all-time high.

The market is betting the Fed will cut interest rates in July and cut two more times this year as Trump's hard bargaining on trade with Beijing and others could push the economy back into recession.

United Technologies fell 4% and Raytheon shed 5.1%, a day after Trump gave mixed signals on whether he believed the $121 billion merger between the companies should go forward. On Monday, Raytheon edged higher while United Technologies lost 3.1%.

The S&P utilities index on Tuesday was down 0.7%.

Symantec Corp (NASDAQ: ) fell after Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) downgraded the antivirus software maker's stock, citing increased competition.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.19-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus said on Friday it had urged United Technologies (NYSE: ) to ""keep its eye on the ball"" in its role as a commercial aerospace supplier as it moves toward a planned merger with U.S. defense contractor Raytheon (NYSE: ).

Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said the message was understood by the world's largest aerospace supplier, whose Pratt & Whitney unit supplies engines for the A320neo jet.

Faury told a news conference he had spoken to UTC leaders and would do so again at the Paris Airshow next week.

LE BOURGET, France (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) F-35 program manager Greg Ulmer said on Monday he had ""no concern"" that the proposed merger of Raytheon (NYSE: ) Co and United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ) would affect the F-35 program or pressure its margins.

""I don't see any concern,"" Ulmer told reporters at the Paris Airshow when asked if the merger of two key suppliers would affect the F-35 program, which is working hard to reduce costs.

Ulmer also said Turkish firms continued to produce components for the aircraft despite a row over Ankara's plans to buy the Russian S-400 air defense system.

He said plans by the U.S. government to start winding down Turkey's participation in the F-35 program would not affect Lockheed's production plan this year.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lockheed-no-concern-that-raytheonutc-merger-will-affect-f35-program-1899149,0.034,0.94,0.025,-0.128

LE BOURGET (Reuters) - An all-electric commuter plane and a small Airbus-backed hybrid are among aircraft programs being touted at the Paris Airshow, as the industry tries to convince a skeptical public it can deliver on a pledge to halve carbon emissions by 2050.

Israeli startup Eviation has wheeled out Alice, a battery-powered nine-seater due for its maiden flight later this year, while Airbus and suppliers Safran (PA: ) and Daher are showing a scale model of their planned EcoPulse, a similarly sized short-hopper that packs a fuel tank as well as batteries.

The electric debuts come as European finance ministers are expected later this week to discuss ending aviation fuel tax exemptions in order to curb greenhouse emissions.

The spread of social media posts ""flight-shaming"" air travel has also jangled executives' nerves and added pressure to electrify, following the auto industry's lead.

Unlike cars, however, electric planes must heft their power packs aloft - a reality that limits them to small aircraft on the shortest routes, as even their proponents concede.

""The impact of battery weight is an order of magnitude more severe for us,"" said Stephane Cueille, Safran's head of research, technology and innovation.

The EcoPulse's engine drives a central propeller and a generator to recharge its batteries and power additional electric props spread along the wingspan, delivering 20-40% fuel savings on trips up to several hundred kilometers.

Whereas the French plane is still on the drawing board, Alice's smooth contours can be seen on the tarmac at Le Bourget, north of Paris. Eviation is aiming for a first test-flight later this year and U.S. certification by 2022.

On a single charge, Alice can fly 650 miles (1,046 kilometers) at 10,000 feet with a cruising speed of 276 miles per hour. Cape Air, a Massachusetts-based regional carrier, has taken an option to add a double-digit number of the $4 million planes to its fleet, Eviation disclosed at the show.

FLYING BATTERY

The aircraft, with a flattened profile and propellers at its wing tips, was designed as an electric plane from the ground up, said Omer Bar-Yohay, Eviation's founder and CEO.

""It's basically a huge battery with some plane painted on it,"" he told reporters.

Among signs of growing interest from traditional players, engine maker Rolls-Royce (LON: ) said on Tuesday it had bought the electric aerospace division of Germany's Siemens - which is also one of the suppliers of motors to Alice.

Engineers see a bigger future for hybrids, which can combine lighter, downsized jet engines with an electric boost during take-off and climb, for a 30% fuel saving. The additional thrusters or e-propellers also help stability, allowing a more streamlined airframe to reduce drag and consumption further.

""Then you're starting to get to the kind of economics and sustainability that's closer to a bus than it is to aviation historically,"" United Technologies (NYSE: ) Chief Technology Officer Paul Eremenko said during a panel discussion.

UBS predicts demand for $178 billion in green aviation technologies by 2040 as they become more mainstream.

""The consumer is probably going to demand an acceleration in this space,"" said Celine Fornaro, the Swiss bank's head of industrials research. ""It's starting to be more present in everyone's conscience.""

Airbus is also looking at hybrid-electric technology for future passenger aircraft generations, but few would bet on its readiness to power the 200-seaters expected to replace the workhorse A320 jet family in the 2030s.

Carbon emissions from commercial aviation account for about 2.5% of the global total but are set to expand in step with emerging middle classes, especially in Asia.

To counter their impact, the industry is introducing the CORSIA program, which requires airlines to fund cuts to atmospheric carbon dioxide elsewhere, offsetting their emissions growth while awaiting hybrid planes and alternative fuels.

'DECADES AWAY'

Reconciling airlines' growth ambitions with their promised 50% carbon emissions cut from 2005 levels will be no easy task.

""We don't know how that's going to happen yet,"" said Greg Hyslop, Boeing's technology chief.

But aerospace leaders are adamant that the answer cannot be fewer flights.

""We've got to make aviation grow and be sustainable,"" Rolls-Royce CTO Paul Stein said during the same panel. ""Those who propose traveling less are heading for a darker place.""

Brussels-based lobby group Airlines for Europe said ""taxing aviation is not a solution"", in a statement ahead of the EU ministerial meetings starting on Thursday in the Netherlands.

But campaigners like Greenpeace transport specialist Sarah Fayolle say taxation and other regulation is warranted by the urgent need to slash emissions.

""We're facing a climate emergency that cannot wait for uncertain technological solutions that are decades away,"" she said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/electric-planes-start-small-as-industry-wrestles-with-emissions-1901610,0.031,0.914,0.056,0.9595

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The edged lower on Monday as losses by healthcare companies overshadowed gains in the technology sector, while investors awaited U.S. President Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit this week.

The Nasdaq slipped but tariff-sensitive industrials, headed up by Boeing (NYSE: ) Co, led the blue-chip to a nominal advance.

While the bellwether S&P 500 ended the session in the red, it remained within a hair's breadth of its all-time closing high reached last Thursday as markets reacted to a dovish statement from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Market players hope Trump and Xi will de-escalate the trade war that has been blamed for a global economic slowdown.

""Today's very quiet,"" said Bruce Monrad, chairman and trustee at Northeast Investors Trust in Boston. ""People are digesting the Fed and looking forward to possible outcomes of the G20 and how that could in turn affect the Fed going forward.""

A Fed rate cut in July ""may be locked and loaded but could be somewhat contingent on what happens at the G20,"" Monrad added.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8.41 points, or 0.03%, to 26,727.54, the S&P 500 lost 5.11 points, or 0.17%, to 2,945.35 and the dropped 26.01 points, or 0.32%, to 8,005.70.

Six of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 lost ground, with the biggest percentage drop for energy stocks as crude prices fell.

In the latest trade-related squabble, FedEx Corp (NYSE: ) apologized for mistakenly returning a Huawei phone to its sender, after misrouting packages from the Chinese tech firm last month. The move provoked the ire of Chinese authorities and raised the prospect of FedEx being added to China's ""unreliable entities"" list. The package delivery firm's shares slid by 2.7%.

Caesars Entertainment Corp jumped 14.5% on news that rival Eldorado Resorts Inc had agreed to buy the casino operator for $8.5 billion. Eldorado dropped 10.6%.

United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ) advanced 1.1% after Cowen & Co upgraded it to ""outperform"" from ""market perform.""

Celgene Corp (NASDAQ: ) slipped 5.5% after Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: ) Co announced that its planned $74 billion deal to buy the drugmaker was expected to close at the end of 2019 or beginning 2020, later than expected. Bristol-Myers fell 7.4%.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.44-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.27-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb said on Friday that his hedge fund Third Point LLC will vote against the planned merger of United Technologies Corp (N: ) and Raytheon Co (N: ), saying there is no ""strategic rationale for this transaction.""

""We have concluded that the proposed combination of United Technologies and Raytheon is ill-conceived and unlikely to create value for UTC shareholders,"" Loeb wrote in a letter to the board of directors at United Technologies. Reuters saw a copy of the letter.

Loeb sent his letter three weeks after United Technologies announced a $120 billion merger with defense contractor Raytheon, making for one of the largest aero-defense deals ever.

Loeb criticizes management for turning back on plans to sharpen its focus and accountability by breaking itself into three businesses; aerospace, Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners.

Neither United Technologies nor Raytheon was immediately available to comment.

Calling the planned merger a ""baffling change in UTC’s strategy,"" Loeb wrote ""the rationale for the breakup was to increase focus and accountability. This transaction represents a clear reversal.""

Loeb is now the second powerful Wall Street investor to oppose the deal after rival hedge fund manager William Ackman wrote to United Technologies to complain even before the deal was publicly announced.

Both Loeb and Ackman, widely respected as powerful activist investors, pushed last year for the company to sharpen its focus and supported the planned split into three businesses.

Neither Loeb, whose firm owns 0.75 percent of the company, nor Ackman, whose Pershing Square (NYSE: ) Capital Management holds a 0.67 percent, would have the shares to single-handedly derail the deal. But both men said they are confident that other investors are similarly outraged and will also oppose it.

Both men accused United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes of trying to extend his reach with Loeb writing on Friday that a ""sweetheart employment agreement"" for Hayes would ""entrench him for another half a decade ultimately as both CEO and Chairman of the Board!""

Bloomberg first reported that Loeb sent the letter to United Technologies.

United Technologies' deal with Raytheon faces regulatory hurdles.

""We have concluded that the proposed combination of United Technologies and Raytheon is ill-conceived and unlikely to create value for UTC shareholders,"" Loeb wrote in a letter to the board of directors of United Technologies

On June 10, the industrial conglomerate and military contractor announced a $120 billion merger, a deal that would intensify the pace of consolidation in the aerospace and defense industry and is expected to be completed in the first half of next year.

In his letter, Loeb criticized United Technologies management for turning its back on previous plans to break the company into three businesses - aerospace, Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners - and accused United Technologies Chief Executive Greg Hayes of engineering the merger to secure his employment.

United Technologies said it does not agree with Loeb's conclusions, adding that its board remains confident that the merger will create a premier systems provider. Other shareholders ""agree with us as to the desirability of the merger,"" the company said.

Loeb, a forceful supporter of United Technologies' plan to break into three businesses, called the planned merger a ""baffling change in UTC’s strategy.""

Loeb is now the second powerful Wall Street investor to oppose the deal after rival hedge fund manager William Ackman wrote to United Technologies to complain even before the deal was publicly announced.

Neither Loeb nor Ackman, whose firms each own less than 1 percent of the company, could single-handedly derail the deal and each has said there are other investors who share their concerns.

By Wayne Cole

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares crept higher on Wednesday as the prospect of fresh Sino-U.S. trade talks drew a guarded welcome, while the euro hit lows on a range of counterparts amid speculation the European Central Bank was near to easing policy.

Sentiment had been helped by a Bloomberg report that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would travel to Shanghai next week for meetings with Chinese officials.

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Tuesday called it a good sign and said he expected Beijing to start buying U.S. agriculture products soon.

Japan's added 0.3%, while Australian stocks were up 0.7% after hitting all-time highs. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.1% and Chinese blue chips climbed 0.8%.

Not so welcome was news the U.S. Justice Department was opening an antitrust investigation of major digital tech firms and possible anticompetitive practices.

The department cited concerns about ""search, social media, and some retail services online"" -- an apparent reference to Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: ).

Facebook reports results on Wednesday, and Amazon and Alphabet on Thursday.

Nasdaq futures fell 0.3% in Asian trade, while E-Mini futures for both the S&P 500 and EUROSTOXX 50 were all but flat.

The investigation announcement took a little of the gloss off a solid overnight session for Wall Street, where upbeat quarterly reports from Coca-Cola (NYSE: ) and United Technologies (NYSE: ) helped ease some concerns about earnings. ( )

The had ended Tuesday up 0.65%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.68% and the Nasdaq 0.58%.

Stocks are just a whisker away from all-time highs buoyed by expectations of a wave of policy stimulus by global central banks and a resulting sharp decline in bond yields.

The ECB is thought likely to at least offer a nod to easier policy at its meeting on Thursday.

Futures remain 100% priced for a rate cut of 25 basis points from the Federal Reserve next week, and even imply an 18% chance of 50 basis points.

EURO BREAKS DOWN

The prospect of wide-scale central bank largesse helped take the sting out of the IMF's latest downgrade to its global growth forecasts.

Although yields on two-year Treasuries edged up to 1.837% overnight, they remain far below the cash rate and down 66 basis points for the year so far.

In currencies, the dollar got a hand up from a deal to end the U.S. budget impasse, while the euro suffered a bout of nerves in case the ECB takes a more dovish turn.

The single currency was down near two-month lows at $1.1144, having shed 0.5% overnight. It also hit a near seven-month trough on the yen at 120.45 and a two-year low on the Swiss franc.

The dollar was steady on the yen at 108.13, and near a five-week top on a basket of currencies at 97.735.

Sterling loitered at $1.2440 having fallen for three sessions in a row as the outlook on Brexit got ever murkier.

Boris Johnson is set to become Britain's new prime minister later on Wednesday, but investors are no clearer on whether he would lead the country to a no-deal exit or find a compromise.

""We may see more market volatility if the EU refuses to renegotiate the existing UK withdrawal agreement,"" said BNY Mellon's fixed income portfolio manager Howard Cunningham.

""There is scope for sterling to weaken further,"" he added. ""It is also possible it could match some of the lows it hit just after the EU referendum in 2016 if there is no sign of movement from either side in any further withdrawal negotiations.""

Gold steadied at $1,420.59 per ounce, though it was still short of last week's peak at $1,452.60.

Oil prices firmed after an industry group reported a surprisingly large drop in U.S. inventories, while the U.S. Navy said it may have downed a second Iranian drone last week. [O/R]

BOSTON (Reuters) - William Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE: ) Capital Management has sold its positions in Automatic Data Processing Inc (O: ) and United Technologies Corp (N: ) and built a new position in a company whose name has not been disclosed, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday.

Ackman announced the exit from ADP in a letter sent to clients and seen by Reuters on Monday. Investors earned a 51% return, including dividends, on the investment and his firm Pershing Square made $1.2 billion on the bet which was made roughly two years ago, Ackman said.

Ackman has also told investors privately that the firm exited its investment in United Technologies Corp (N: ) after the hedge fund manager in June urged the company to call off its planned merger with Raytheon (NYSE: ).

Ackman sent a letter to the chief executive of United Technologies saying he was ""extremely concerned"" about the merger which is slated to occur after United Technologies spins off its Carrier and Otis businesses next year.

The announcements about ADP and UTX are the most significant moves Ackman has unveiled this year and come at a time his firm is making waves with double-digit returns as Ackman himself stays largely out of the limelight.

Through July, Pershing Square Holdings, Ackman's publicly traded portfolio, has gained 49.4%, compared with the average hedge fund's return of roughly 5% during the same period.

Ackman wrote that he exited ADP because he expects future returns to be more modest now that the market is ""more accurately pricing in ADP's prospects for success.""

He told analysts that the firm had exited United Technologies at a meeting last week.

A Pershing Square spokesman declined to comment on Monday.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ackmans-pershing-square-exited-adp-and-utx-investments-source-1946313,0.0,0.923,0.077,0.9695

BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Third Point LLC said on Tuesday that it recently cut its investment in United Technologies Corp (N: ), becoming the second activist hedge fund to sell shares after the company announced a merger with Raytheon Co . (N: ) that the funds said they would not support.

The New York-based firm sold 480,000 shares of United Technologies stock during the second quarter, cutting its holding by 7 percent to 6 million shares, according to a regulatory filing made on Tuesday.

In June, Third Point founder Daniel Loeb told the company its plan to merge with Raytheon was a ""baffling change"" in strategy.

Last week William Ackman, another prominent activist investor, told clients that his Pershing Square (NYSE: ) Capital Management had sold all of its 5.8 million United Technologies shares.

Ackman was the first to voice strong opposition to the proposed merger and wrote to United Technologies' chief executive in early June that he could not understand the deal's logic.

Both hedge funds, whose moves can influence other investors, told United Technologies that they did not approve of the deal, which is expected to come to a vote next year.

United Technologies is in the process of streamlining its operations, actions both hedge funds endorsed, by selling off its Otis elevator and Carrier buildings systems units.

The sales by both Ackman and Loeb are noteworthy because United Technologies had been big holdings in each man's portfolio.

At Pershing Square, which invests roughly $8 billion, the United Technologies position made up roughly 11 percent of the portfolio at the end of the first quarter. Pershing Square has not yet made its so-called 13-F, a filing that details the amount of U.S. stock held by investment companies at the end of the previous quarter.

While 13-F filings are backward looking, they are closely watched all the same by investors for hints on what big, often secretive hedge funds are thinking. The bulk of the filings will be made on Wednesday.

At Third Point, United Technologies remains the firm's second largest position, making up roughly 10% of its $15 billion portfolio, at the end of the second quarter, Tuesday's filing shows.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/third-point-cuts-united-technologies-stake-after-opposing-raytheon-deal-1953750,0.014,0.885,0.101,0.9858

BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire U.S. investor William Ackman has long described how Warren Buffett, often called the greatest stock picker ever, has influenced his career. Now he's paying the Oracle (NYSE: ) of Omaha the ultimate homage with a new investment in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (N: ) (N: ).

Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE: ) Capital Management bought 3.5 million Berkshire Hathaway B shares during the second quarter, the fund manager said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. At Wednesday's close, the investment would be worth roughly $686 million.

It marks the first time that Ackman's $8 billion fund has announced a new position since late last year when it bought a stake in Starbucks Corp (O: ).

The new stake in the company with a $510 billion market capitalization will be a passive investment for Ackman's firm, a person familiar with his thinking said.

Pershing Square made its reputation as an activist investment firm by pushing for changes at companies ranging from railway Canadian Pacific (TO: ) to restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (N: ).

But Ackman is unlikely to offer suggestions or work behind the scenes to persuade the 88-year old Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's founder and leader, to change direction.

Indeed, Ackman has publicly credited Buffett with guiding his career. The 53-year old said he has studiously taken pointers from Buffett's investor letters, including the ones he wrote before creating Berkshire Hathaway. Four years ago, Forbes featured Ackman on the cover of its magazine, calling him 'Baby Buffett.'

At first blush, the investment might seem odd, as Berkshire Hathaway ranks among the world's best known stocks - one that parents often bestow as graduation gifts, designed to hold onto for a lifetime. Two Pershing investors Reuters spoke to grumbled that they would pay hedge fund-like fees for a name everyone knows.

But other investors and analysts called it a smart move and described it as a place for Ackman to put cash while searching for another activist position.

Currently Berkshire stock is considered to be less expensive than it has been for some time, having fallen 9% in the last three months.

One reason might be the Kraft-Heinz merger which Berkshire and private equity company 3G Capital engineered in 2015 and which Buffett said earlier this year that he overpaid for.

NEXT TARGET

Speculation has mounted for a week about what Ackman's next position might be after he told investors that he had exited Automatic Data Processing (ADP) (O: ) and United Technologies (N: ) and had a new position on.

Pershing Square has gained roughly 50% during the first seven months of this year, making it one of the world's best performing investment firms.

The gains illustrate how Ackman's efforts to rebuild his performance record after a few rocky years are bearing fruit, with bets on Starbucks and Chipotle proving to be big winners.

Recent changes in the portfolio also suggest that Ackman is not likely to hold onto an investment where he sees potential problems or where there is not much money to be made ahead.

He bought United Technologies in the first quarter of 2018 and exited after the company announced a planned merger with Raytheon (N: ) that he told management he did not like.

He owned ADP from the middle of 2017 and worked behind the scenes with management after having lost a proxy contest two years ago.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investigators probing an engine explosion on an Air France A380 in 2017 are studying a possible manufacturing flaw in a recently salvaged cracked part in a move likely to trigger urgent checks on dozens of Airbus superjumbos, people familiar with the matter said.

The focus of a two-year-old investigation into the mid-air explosion over Greenland, which left the plane carrying more than 500 passengers with the front of one engine missing, has switched to the recently recovered ""fan hub,"" the people said.

The titanium alloy part is the centerpiece of a 3-metre-wide fan on engines built for the world's largest airliner by U.S.-based Engine Alliance, co-owned by General Electric (N: ) and United Technologies unit Pratt & Whitney (N: ).

It had sat buried in Greenland's ice sheet since September 2017 when one of four engines on Air France flight 66 abruptly disintegrated en route from Paris to Los Angeles. It was prised from the ice in June after a high-tech aerial radar search.

Confirming the focus of the probe after Reuters reported the plans for inspections, France's BEA air accident agency said it had discovered a ""sub-surface fatigue crack"" on the recovered part and the engine maker was preparing checks.

The people familiar with the matter linked the crack to a suspected manufacturing flaw and said the checks - to be carried out urgently on engines that have conducted a certain number of flights - would affect dozens of the double-decker jets.

The people said the suspect part was fabricated on behalf of consortium member Pratt & Whitney, which declined to comment.

Engine Alliance is one of two engine suppliers for the Airbus A380 in competition with Britain’s Rolls-Royce (L: ).

Its engines power a total of 152 aircraft or just over 60 percent of the 237 A380s in service.

Besides Air France, other airlines operating the A380 with Engine Alliance powerplants include Dubai's Emirates, Qatar Airways, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad and Korean Air.

The checks will involve taking some planes out of service outside their usual maintenance schedules, one source said.

Investigations are not complete and are likely to tackle other features such as the loads or physical forces at play. Experts say air accidents are rarely caused by isolated factors.

Europe's Airbus (PA: ) declined to comment.

SIOUX CITY REMEMBERED

Nobody was hurt in the September 2017 incident, in which the Air France superjumbo diverted safely to Goose Bay in Canada.

Although rare, uncontained engine failures, in which shrapnel capable of puncturing the fuselage exits an engine at extremely high speeds, automatically raise alarm.

The checks come weeks after relatives marked 30 years since an engine failure left a United Airlines DC-10 with almost no control, culminating in the death of 111 out of the 296 people on board during an attempted landing at Sioux City, Iowa.

U.S. investigators cited a defective titanium alloy part and weak inspection procedures, although they also praised the ""highly commendable"" performance of the crew of flight 232.

The July 1989 crash sped up improvements in manufacturing methods for titanium alloy. Experts say hidden internal defects in such parts are unusual but remain difficult to detect.

Titanium alloy is used widely in aerospace, which is the metal's biggest customer due to its strength compared to the weight of each part and its ability to handle high temperatures.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-checks-seen-on-some-airbus-a380s-after-2017-engine-explosion-1960178,0.053,0.897,0.051,-0.3121

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on Thursday named 22 people to a new panel that will advise the department on aviation safety oversight and certification programs as the Federal Aviation Administration continues to grapple with the fallout from two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes.

The long-time practice of the FAA delegating certification tasks to aircraft manufacturers has come under criticism after the two 737 MAX crashes in five months.

The panel, created last year by Congress, will offer input on ""aircraft and flight standards certification processes, oversight of safety management systems, risk-based oversight efforts, and utilization of delegation and designation authorities,"" the department said.

The panel will be chaired by former Alaska Airlines Chief Executive William Ayer. It includes officials from Delta Air Lines (N: ), GE Aviation (N: ), United Airlines (O: ), Bell Helicopter Textron (N: ), Garmin (O: ), Wing Aviation LLC, Pratt & Whitney - a unit of United Technologies Corp (N: ) - and Gulfstream - a unit of General Dynamics Corp (N: ) - as well as union, airport and trade association officials.

Beth Pasztor, vice president for safety, security and compliance at Boeing Commercial Airplanes (N: ), is also on the panel.

Federal prosecutors, the Department of Transportation’s inspector general, Congress and several blue-ribbon panels are investigating how the FAA certifies new aircraft and the decision to certify the 737 MAX. Last month, U.S. National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt said his agency would outline recommendations on the FAA’s aircraft certification procedures by late September.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-transport-chief-names-aviation-safety-advisory-panel-1961511,0.019,0.883,0.097,0.9708

FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE: ) CEO Guido Kerkhoff has little choice but to sell the group's prized elevator division lock, stock and barrel so he can save the conglomerate's remaining businesses, four sources close to the German company said.

Kerkhoff's preferred option is to list a minority stake in Thyssenkrupp's Elevator Technology (ET) but with financial pressures mounting on the company, a formal auction process that could get a deal faster has been launched, the sources said.

They said it would take at least until early 2020 to launch an IPO and a listing would only produce the best valuation in the right market environment - something that Kerkhoff cannot count on.

Kerkhoff said earlier this month that management would look at concrete offers and make a decision based on what is best for the group, its shareholders and the division.

""To rebuild the company you need cash,"" said Tomas Johansson, portfolio manager at SKAGEN Funds. ""Everyone knows that Thyssenkrupp needs to sell elevators. That's seldom the best time to do a transaction but they have no choice.""

Thyssenkrupp, whose roots go back more than two centuries, has been under pressure for years from shareholders - especially its second largest, Cevian Capital - to simplify its sprawling empire which includes subsidiaries making elevators, steel, car parts, warships, chemical plants and submarines.

The conglomerate's complex mix of disparate assets - 449 companies in 78 countries - is the result of efforts to diversify beyond steel-making through acquisitions and mergers, leaving the company hard to manage.

Efforts to slim down its portfolio suffered a setback when a proposed merger of its steel-making operations with Tata Steel's (NS: ) European divisions failed in May in the face of more demands from European antitrust regulators for concessions.

When the steel merger collapsed, Kerkhoff announced the plan to list ET, the world's fourth-biggest lift maker, and explore new ownership structures for some of its remaining units, including materials trading and plant engineering.

Initially welcomed by investors, doubts about the viability and effectiveness of Kerkhoff's plan have intensified as he struggles to stop what he calls ""the bleeding"" of cash.

At the moment, the group is losing 2.7 million euros ($3 million) of cash a day and will probably be kicked out of Germany's blue-chip index next month. Its debt is now deeper in junk territory following more downgrades this month from ratings agencies S&P and Moody's.

Thyssenkrupp's shares are trading near 16-year lows and its gearing stood at a staggering 204.5% at the end of June - meaning its net debt was twice as high as its total equity - all of which puts pressure on Kerkhoff to restructure quickly.

BULLSEYE NEEDED

As part of the elevator sale process, which kicks off in the fall, Kerkhoff has reached out to private equity firms to discuss offers, the sources said. Potential bidders include KKR (N: ), CVC, Advent, Apollo (N: ), EQT, as well as Finnish elevator rival Kone (HE: ), among others.

First-round bids for the lift division, which is valued at anywhere from 12 billion to 17 billion euros, are expected in November with final offers due in January, one of the sources said.

Thyssenkrupp declined to comment on expected valuations or a timeline for any sale process.

The advantage of an outright sale to private equity firms - some of which are forming consortia to bid - is that a deal could be faster than an IPO and less exposed to the vagaries of the stock market, two people familiar with the matter said.

But private equity firms would probably demand outright control of the asset, forcing Kerkhoff to draw up a new business model for Thyssenkrupp without its elevator business.

One person also said the market's lack of confidence in Thyssenkrupp's management would make it unlikely that the company would be allowed to retain a significant stake.

Thyssenkrupp wants to ""maximize value while minimizing execution risks"", a separate source told Reuters, explaining that bids by rival elevator companies risked lengthy antitrust reviews while private equity bids would be easier to pull off.

A takeover by Kone, for example, would combine the world's third- and fourth-biggest elevator makers in market already dominated by a few large firms. The biggest, Otis, is itself being spun off from United Technologies Corp (N: ) next year.

""Antitrust ... is definitely a big, big hurdle for any attempt,"" said Thomas Oetterli, CEO of Switzerland's Schindler (S: ), the world's second biggest elevator maker by sales, adding it would be ""incredibly difficult to get approvals"".

It might be less of a problem for smaller rivals including Japan's Mitsubishi Electric (T: ), Fujitec (T: ) and Hitachi (T: ), one of the sources said.

Thomas Hechtfischer, managing director of shareholder advisory group DSW, which typically represents 1% of Thyssenkrupp's voting rights at annual general meetings, said there was no room for further missteps by Kerkhoff.

""The next shot needs to be a bullseye,"" he said.

'BAD ASSET'

Further chipping away at Kerkhoff's credibility, which has suffered from botched efforts to spin off Thyssenkrupp's capital goods units, are plans to restructure, sell or shut down those divisions burning the most cash.

The problem is that all those subsidiaries - system engineering, springs and stabilizers and heavy plate - operate in the steel and autos sectors, industries that have come under extreme pressure in recent months.

""Why would you try and sell a bad asset in a market environment at the worst possible time?"" one person familiar with the plans said.

Winding down the units, an option Kerkhoff has said was not being ruled out, will not be easy either. With a combined staff of 9,300, closing them would incur large restructuring costs at a time when Thyssenkrupp's balance sheet is already stretched.

Some analysts argue that far greater job cuts are needed. Bucephalus Research estimates that sacking 30,000 people, or 19% of total staff, is necessary for a serious overhaul but it would involve restructuring costs of about 3 billion euros.

Without an injection of cash from a sale of ET, Kerkhoff would struggle to fund even a portion of these layoffs - even if powerful labor representatives, who control half of the 20 seats on Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board, give the go-ahead.

""We are prepared for change but not at any price,"" said Markus Grolms, vice chairman of Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board and trade secretary at Germany's most powerful union, IG Metall. ""Swinging the axe does not address the group's problems.""

Grolms said it needed to improve the operating performance of its divisions, most of which are lagging rivals, echoing comments from the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen and Halbach Foundation, Thyssenkrupp's largest shareholder with a 21% stake.

Tapping new growth markets and developing innovative products would also require substantial funds, putting pressure on Kerkhoff to get his next move right after a series of setbacks, including four profit warnings under his watch.

""Thyssenkrupp faces a very challenging situation. The market environment and the economy have continued to deteriorate,"" the foundation said, adding that it supported the company's strategic path and remained convinced of its potential.

""The foundation wants the company to be competitive in its operating businesses, providing secure jobs and a sustainable ability to pay dividends.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/thyssenkrupp-ceos-last-roll-of-the-dice-sell-the-family-silver-1966134,0.081,0.828,0.091,0.9632

FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Finland's Kone (HE: ) is considering teaming up with a private equity partner to pull off a bid for Thyssenkrupp's (DE: ) elevator business, three people familiar with the matter said.

Kone has long been interested in Elevator Technology (ET) - which analysts say could be worth as much as 17 billion euros ($19 billion) - and has been exploring options for a deal with the help of Bank of America (N: ), sources told Reuters in May.

The Finnish company could mitigate antitrust risks by potentially selling assets to the partner, one of the people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.

No final decision has been made and Kone could still decide to submit an offer for the unit on its own, the people said.

Thyssenkrupp has said that it could sell or list its elevator business, which is by far its most profitable division.

Shares in the group, which will be kicked out of Germany's benchmark index later this month following a sharp fall in its market value, extended gains to close up 6.2% on the news that Kone was considering a bid with a partner.

Due to its large overlap with ET, a bid by Kone is likely to raise antitrust issues and would require substantial remedies to get approval, the sources said, adding that teaming up with private equity players would be a way to sidestep concerns.

Sources told Reuters on Wednesday that KKR (N: ), CVC, Bain and EQT were among those who received a letter from Thyssenkrupp asking them to express their interest in ET by the middle of the month.

PERFECT FIT

Kone declined to comment on whether it would team up with a partner to make a bid. But the group's CEO, in an interview on Thursday, said ET would be a perfect strategic fit for Kone.

""We have evaluated different scenarios and take the view that a tie-up is possible from an antitrust point of view. Both companies would benefit,"" Henrik Ehrnrooth told Rheinische Post in an interview.

He said Thyssenkrupp was stronger than Kone in North America, while Kone had a better position in Asia. ""In this combination we'd be faster and could tackle digital challenges more efficiently.""

In Kone's case, synergies are expected to be around 600 million euros annually, a person close to the deal said.

Rival elevator makers are in a position to pay a significantly higher price for ET as they would benefit from cost savings in a potential merger. At the same time, they would face higher antitrust hurdles than private equity firms.

Of the world's top elevator makers - which also include Otis (N: ) and Schindler (S: ) - Hitachi (T: ) would have the fewest antitrust issues, the people said.

German industrial conglomerate Siemens (DE: ), which has a strong building technologies business, is not interested in Thyssenkrupp's elevator unit and did not receive a letter on Wednesday, several people close to the matter said.

While Siemens has looked at a possible expansion into the elevators business in the past, it dismissed that idea after finding that there would be little synergy with its other businesses, the people said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/kone-explores-partnership-to-bid-for-thyssenkrupp-elevator-business-sources-1971419,0.008,0.895,0.097,0.9926

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Record heatwaves in Europe and Asia this summer are leading fund managers to buy shares of air conditioning manufacturers, betting that the public health risks of rising temperatures will compel businesses and apartment building owners to install cooling systems.

Shares of Johnson Controls (NYSE: ) International Plc, United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ), and Ingersoll-Rand Plc, are all up 25% or more since the start of the year, well above the 19% gain in the U.S. benchmark . Those gains come despite concerns about slowing global economic growth due to the lingering trade war between the United States and China that have weighed on the industrial sector.

Japanese companies Daikin Industries Ltd and Hitachi Ltd are also up strongly year-to-date.

Fund managers and analysts say the recent outperformance will likely continue due to the necessity of cooling systems as temperatures rise globally. Paris hit 42.6 degrees Celsius (108.7 Fahrenheit) in July, the highest in the city's recorded history, while Britain reported its hottest July on record. Heat waves contributed to the deaths of 1,435 people in France this summer, the country's health ministry said Sunday.

""This is an issue that isn't going away and it will certainly continue to drive adoption"" of air conditioning in regions that traditionally have not relied on it, said Rob McIver, a portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management. McIver owns shares of United Technologies, which is spinning its Carrier business off into a separate company, expected to become independent next year.

Europe will likely be a large growth market despite the outsized costs of retrofitting older buildings with new cooling systems, said Nicholas Heymann, co-group head – global industrial infrastructure at William Blair. Currently, only about 20% of European households have air conditioning, compared with 87% percent of U.S. households and 90% in Japan, due in part to greater emphasis on less energy-intensive forms of cooling in Europe.

""It's something that's structurally more challenging in Europe, and conceptually too, because Europeans tend to be more environmentally-conscious. But personal safety is going to be a bigger issue and they are going to have to come to terms with retrofitting,"" he said.

That market would likely be particularly lucrative for Johnson Controls International, where cooling systems make up approximately 50 percent of its revenues and it has a lead in so-called mini-split systems, which do not require expensive ducts to send cool air through buildings, Heymann said.

The number of European households that buy and install a new air conditioning system will increase by an average of 4.3% a year through 2040 as more people move to cities, according to a study published in Environmental Science & Policy in July. Overall, global air conditioner sales will increase by 700 million units by 2030 and 1.6 billion by 2050, driven mostly by sales in developing countries such as India, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Energy.

A slowdown in new construction in Asia, which has accounted for the majority of the sector's growth, would likely weigh on the shares of air conditioning makers overall, said Noah Kaye, a senior analyst at Oppenheimer. Yet that could make companies such as Johnson Controls, which has seen its trailing price-to-earnings multiple jump nearly 72% over the last year, more attractive on a valuation standpoint, he said.

""There is a real opportunity here that's under the radar"" if Europe begins to adopt greater usage of air conditioning than its historical trends, Kaye said. ""The use of air conditioning begets more air conditioning, and that's a trend we see continuing as the world gets hotter.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/climate-change-pushes-us-fund-managers-to-bet-on-ac-makers-1976909,0.009,0.9,0.091,0.9927

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Finland's Kone (HE: ) is open to a co-shareholding structure in a potential deal to merge with Thyssenkrupp's (DE: ) elevator division, its chief executive told Bloomberg News.

""Clearly, we would welcome Thyssenkrupp as an owner in this new entity and that way share the long-term benefits with us,"" Henrik Ehrnrooth told the agency in an interview.

Kone could bid for Thyssenkrupp's elevator division - which the ailing conglomerate has put up for sale - through a mix of cash and shares, which might give Thyssenkrupp a minority stake in the merged entity, people close to the deal have said.

Kone is the world's third-largest maker of elevators behind U.S.-based Otis (N: ) and Switzerland's Schindler (S: ). Thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology, which some analysts say could be worth as much as 17 billion euros ($19 billion), ranks fourth.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/kone-open-to-coshareholding-with-thyssenkrupp-in-elevator-deal-bloomberg-1977466,0.0,0.932,0.068,0.872

BOSTON (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (N: ) ranked as the top financial adviser in activist campaigns during the first six months of 2019 while Goldman Sachs (N: ) and Spotlight Advisors each added clients and tied for second place, according to Refinitiv data.

Holding onto the No. 1 spot, Morgan Stanley advised 19 companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N: ) and United Technologies Corp (N: ), in the first half of 2019. A year ago, when activists launched more campaigns overall, Morgan Stanley counseled 23 companies in the first six months of 2018.

A year ago, Goldman Sachs advised 12 companies while Spotlight, which works for both companies and activist investors, worked on 10 campaigns.

The top adviser rankings are closely watched in a world where investors push corporations for improvements by urging strategic reviews and asking for board seats, among other pressures brought to bear on the corner office.

Starboard Value tied with Saba Capital Management for busiest activist as each firm launched seven campaigns in the first half. Saba, run by Boaz Weinstein, has been targeting closed-end funds. Elliott Management, which ranked as busiest activist with 16 campaigns a year ago, was in third place with four engagements in the first half.

Okapi Partners held onto its spot as the busiest proxy solicitor, firms that gather shareholders' votes, with 24 campaigns.

(Reuters) - The chief technology officer of United Technologies Corp (N: ), Paul Eremenko, has stepped down, just under two years after moving to the U.S. conglomerate from Europe's Airbus (PA: ).

The company confirmed the move in response to a query from Reuters after a person familiar with the matter said Eremenko was leaving UTC, the world's largest aerospace supplier and owner of jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney.

""Paul Eremenko has informed us of his intention to pursue opportunities outside the company,"" UTC spokeswoman Michele Quintaglie said by email.

Eremenko notified the company on Tuesday and his departure is effective immediately, she said.

He could not be reached immediately for comment.

As CTO, Eremenko led UTC’s technology and engineering business, Quintaglie said. Nicolas Pujet, part of UTC’s strategy team, will be interim leader of technology and engineering as UTC prepares for a merger with defense giant Raytheon (N: ), expected to close next year.

Former Google (NASDAQ: ) executive Eremenko has taken a public role in efforts by aerospace groups to import radical thinking from Silicon Valley, as digital technology reshapes the industry.

At the Paris Airshow in June, Eremenko unveiled an initiative dubbed ""Project 804"" to build a hybrid-electric turboprop demonstrator aimed at saving 30% of fuel consumption.

PARIS/VIENNA (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney (N: ) recommended checks on engines on Airbus (PA: ) A220 aircraft and some Embraer (SA: ) jets after a Geneva-bound Swiss jet diverted to Paris with an engine problem, prompting the grounding of the rest of the airline's A220 fleet.

French air accident investigators classified the problem that disrupted the Swiss flight shortly after departure from London Heathrow as a ""serious incident"" and said it would be investigated by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.

Swiss, owned by Germany's Lufthansa (DE: ), said it had grounded its fleet of 29 Airbus A220 jets for a review of their engines.

""Only after a comprehensive inspection will the aircraft return to regular flight operations,"" it said in a statement, adding ""numerous flights"" would have to be canceled.

The diversion was the latest in a series of technical glitches involving new-generation Geared Turbofan engines from Pratt & Whitney, part of United Technologies (N: ).

A spokesman for the engine maker said it was recommending additional fleet-wide checks for versions of the engine that power the Airbus A220 - an engine known as the PW1500G - and the upgraded Embraer 190/195-E2.

A similar engine for the larger A320neo family, Airbus's most-sold aircraft, was not affected.

""Pratt & Whitney and our airframe OEMs (manufacturers), working in coordination with the regulatory authorities, have recommended additional inspections of the low-pressure compressor for PW1500G and PW1900G engines to keep the fleet operational,"" a spokesman said.

""The engines continue to meet all criteria for continued airworthiness. We are working closely with our customers to minimize disruption to their operations.""

The spokesman did not say when the recommendation had been made or what deadline existed for the checks.

Delta Air Lines (N: ) said its A220 jets were flying as normal.

Airbus said it was aware of Tuesday's incident involving the aircraft operated by Swiss and that it was working with Pratt & Whitney.

Airbus has delivered a total of 90 of the 110-130-seat A220 in operation, having bought the program from Canada's Bombardier last year.

Embraer did not respond to a request for comment.

The Brazilian company uses Pratt's PW1900G engine in larger versions of its upgraded 80-120-seat E2 jets.

It has delivered six E190-E2 planes split between Norwegian carrier Wideroe and lessor Aercap (N: ), and one E195-E2, which is not yet in commercial service but has been delivered to Brazilian airline Azul SA.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/new-pratt-engine-checks-after-swiss-a220-diverts-to-paris-1996644,0.02,0.958,0.022,-0.0844

VIENNA (Reuters) - Airline Swiss expects to resume mostly normal service with its fleet of Airbus A220 jets on Thursday after temporarily grounding the jets for safety checks of their engines, it said on Wednesday.

The inspections of Pratt & Whitney engines came after a Geneva-bound Swiss jet had to divert to Paris on Tuesday.

French air crash investigators classified the engine problem, which disrupted the Swiss flight shortly after departure from London Heathrow, as a ""serious incident"" and said it would be investigated by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.

The carrier said that 20 of the aircraft had been inspected on Tuesday afternoon and overnight. ""The engines are in impeccable condition, so these 20 aircraft have returned to regular flight operations,"" it added in a statement.

""We continue to assume that flight operations can be largely resumed on Thursday,"" added the airline, which is owned by Germany's Lufthansa (DE: ).

The Airbus (PA: ) A220 single-aisle airliner was formerly known as the Bombardier C Series.

In Seoul, Korean Air Lines Co Ltd (KS: ) said it had launched inspections on its fleet of 10 A220 planes after a request from U.S. engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney.

Tuesday's engine incident was the third involving the same airline and model of jet in as many months and resulted in a small amount of debris being scattered as the aircraft landed at Paris Charles de Gaulle, an airport source told Reuters.

It came just hours after France's BEA aviation safety agency launched an unusual appeal for 150 volunteers to scour an uninhabited wood in eastern France for a titanium engine part dating from the first blowout in July, which affected a Geneva-London flight.

A second incident in September caused a Swiss A220 to divert to Geneva, but on that occasion the engine's housing contained fragments torn loose from the engine, the BEA said.

Swiss said this week's inspections had forced it to cancel more than 100 flights, affecting around 10,000 passengers.

The Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation said it had not ordered the grounding for engine checks.

Tuesday's incident highlighted scrutiny of the performance of new-generation Geared Turbofan engines developed by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (N: ).

A spokesman for the engine maker said it was recommending additional checks for versions of the engine that power the Airbus A220 - an engine known as the PW1500G - and a rival Brazilian jet, the Embraer 190/195-E2.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - IndiGo (NS: ) must replace all Pratt & Whitney (P&W) engines on its fleet of 97 twin-engined Airbus A320neo family aircraft with new P&W power units, India's air safety watchdog said on Friday following recent inflight engine shutdowns.

The incidents have caused ""serious concern"" and the decision to order the engines be replaced was taken after ""considerable deliberations,"" the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said in a statement.

""You will appreciate that four successive events have not happened ever before and therefore, we call for urgent and effective action. We regret the inconvenience but we need desperate measures to put things in order,"" the DGCA said.

""This situation cannot be allowed to go on indefinitely,"" it said, adding that the engines would need to be replaced by Jan. 31, 2020.

IndiGo is Airbus' (PA: ) biggest client for A320neo planes.

While the United Technologies' (N: ) Pratt & Whitney engines are fuel efficient there have been issues since they entered into service in 2016, forcing the airline to ground its planes several times.

The groundings have cost IndiGo, which last month posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss after being forced to lease aircraft to replace planes grounded with engine issues.

On Monday the DGCA ordered IndiGo and domestic rival GoAir to modify 29 Airbus A320neo aircraft fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines within 15 days to avoid them being grounded.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/india-orders-indigo-to-replace-all-pratt-engines-on-airbus-a320neo-planes-2009842,0.064,0.877,0.059,-0.3291

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Boeing's (N: ) grounded 737 MAX airliner is likely to return to service in Europe during the first quarter of 2020, the head of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said on Monday.

While the European regulator expects to give its approval in January, preparations by national authorities and airlines may delay the resumption of commercial flights by up to another two months, EASA executive director Patrick Ky indicated.

""If there are training requirements (and) coordination to be done with the EU member states to make sure everyone does the same thing at the same time, this will take a bit of time,"" Ky said. ""That's why I'm saying the first quarter of 2020.""

Boeing has said it aims to return the 737 MAX to service by the end of 2019 after making software changes in the wake of two deadly crashes, which killed 346 people and led the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ground the plane in March.

Besides damaging Boeing, the grounding has hit airline customers due to the hundreds of jets now stuck on the tarmac. Low-cost operator Ryanair (I: ), one of Boeing's biggest MAX clients, said on Monday it expected further delays to MAX deliveries to reduce its growth in 2020.

The FAA has primary responsibility for vetting a Boeing-designed fix to avoid situations in which data from a single faulty airflow sensor can cause the flight software to send the plane into a dive. Instead, the so-called MCAS software will monitor data from a pair of the sensors.

EASA also plans to carry out its own program of checks including simulator and flight tests, before allowing flights to resume in Europe.

European experts traveled to Rockwell Collins (NYSE: ) facilities in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, last week to begin an audit of a ""reasonably final"" software version, the EASA chief told Reuters on the sidelines of the agency's annual safety conference in Helsinki. Rockwell Collins, a unit of United Technologies (N: ), developed the MAX flight control software with Boeing.

""There has been a lot of work done on the design of the software,"" Ky said. But he added: ""We think there is still some work to be done.""

Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe declined to comment. A spokesman for the FAA also declined to comment.

Ky would not elaborate on the likelihood that regulators will require additional simulator training for MAX pilots, which would add more delay and cost for many airline customers.

That decision can be taken only after EASA's own simulator and flight tests, he said. ""It's really at the end of the process because it's much more operational.""

The European watchdog hopes to complete a detailed software review by the end of this month, followed by December flight tests ""if everything goes well"", he added.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/boeings-grounded-max-seen-resuming-europe-flights-in-firstquarter-easa-2011448,0.027,0.941,0.032,0.34

PARIS (Reuters) - French volunteer search teams have found fragments from an engine that exploded in mid-air over eastern France in July, officials said on Wednesday.

The discovery came in an unprecedented search operation involving 150 members of the public after French air accident investigation agency BEA asked volunteers to help comb a forest for a titanium engine part following two engine explosions on Airbus A220 jets operated by the airline Swiss since July.

A third engine suffered a similar blowout last month, forcing it to divert to Paris where it scattered some parts during landing, according to French officials.

""Three fragments from the engine have been found by the ... volunteer team ... Thanks to all participants of this first day,"" BEA said on its Twitter feed.

The engine incidents have prompted worldwide engine checks on Airbus A220 and some Embraer aircraft, but no flaws have been found.

They have heightened scrutiny of a new generation of fuel-saving engines built by U.S. manufacturer Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (NYSE: ), after a series of reliability problems. But a version of the engines used on Airbus's larger and more widely used A320 series is not affected by the checks.

Reuters reported last month that a U.S-led investigation was focusing on a recent update in engine software that may have inadvertently allowed parts to resonate or vibrate destructively during certain settings.

Finding the engine fragment could help confirm the theory, though investigators have not ruled out titanium manufacturing problems.

A220 pilots have been told to avoid placing unusually high demands on the engine above 29,000 feet, while a new version of the software is finalised for the first quarter of next year.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/french-team-finds-engine-fragments-that-fell-off-airbus-engine-2013713,0.063,0.887,0.05,-0.7339

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Earlier this week, my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Chris Bryant examined the ongoing troubles for advanced jet engines used on today’s commercial airliners. These engines now seem to be reaching their technical limits, and as Bryant says, we may be asking too much of the technology.

That’s not great news for the companies making those turbines, or for those flying the aircraft. It’s also not the best news for the climate, given the trajectory of emissions from air travel and air freight. Carbon dioxide emissions from commercial aviation made up 2.4% of global emissions in 2018 and, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, have grown 32% in just five years.

The geography of those emissions is highly concentrated. Three markets — the U.S., the European Union and China — account for more than half of all emissions; the top 10 emitters contribute more than 70% of the global total.

There’s something hopeful, actually, in that geographical distribution. High concentration means that tackling emissions in just three markets can have an outsized impact, and standards set in those large markets are easy for others to follow.

There’s another aspect to the distribution of aviation emissions that’s worth examining: emissions by type of aircraft. Bryant writes of problems with engines on both widebody and narrowbody aircraft: the Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (LON: ) Trent 1000 engines used on the widebody Boeing (NYSE: ) Co. 787, and United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ). subsidiary Pratt & Whitney’s geared turbofan used on the narrowbody Airbus SE A320neo. While widebody aircraft make up one-third of global emissions, narrowbody and regional passenger plans are almost half.

If the turbines used to propel the largest and longest-range of aircraft are approaching technical limits but almost half of emissions are from shorter-range and smaller aircraft, then there’s space to innovate, for emissions’ sake, at the short and small end. And that space looks electric and hybrid.

Next month, Vancouver-based Harbour Air will fly its first electric seaplane, a De Havilland DHC-2 Beaver prototype retrofitted with a propulsion system from Seattle-based electric aviation company MagniX. It’s a first look at what electric commercial flight could be, and as it draws upon a sophisticated, global and continually improving network of battery makers while the cost of batteries continues to decrease, it has room to grow. “Because of airborne mobility development, this technology is unstoppable, and it’s getting more practical as every day goes by,” says Greg McDougall, Harbour Air’s CEO. “The brainpower and money involved is snowballing, and there’s no doubt we can roll out what we’re doing to other small airlines.” It’s an infectious enthusiasm, but it just might take to the air elsewhere, too.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Replacing all Pratt & Whitney engines on IndiGo's fleet of almost 100 Airbus planes by Jan. 31, as ordered by India's aviation watchdog, will be challenging but the airline aims to complete the work, its chief executive officer said on Monday.

India's aviation regulator on Nov. 1 ordered IndiGo (NS: ) to replace all Pratt & Whitney (P&W) engines on its fleet of twin-engined Airbus A320neo family aircraft with new P&W power units, following recent inflight engine shutdowns that caused ""serious concern"".

""It's a challenge. But we have every intention of meeting it. Pratt is helping us and we are trying to make that work as fast as we can,"" Ronojoy Dutta, IndiGo CEO, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Dubai airshow.

Low cost carrier IndiGo is Airbus' (PA: ) biggest client for A320neo planes, and while the United Technologies' (N: ) P&W engines are fuel efficient there have been issues since they entered service in 2016, forcing the airline to ground its planes several times.

In June, IndiGo, India's biggest airline, dropped P&W in favor of French-U.S. engine venture CFM by agreeing a record $20 billion deal for more than 600 engines to power Airbus jets already on order.

In October IndiGo placed an order for another 300 A320neo-family jets but it has yet to decide the engine provider - P&W or CFM, which is jointly owned by France's Safran (PA: ) and General Electric (N: ) of the United States.

""We will be talking to both Pratt and CFM, whoever has the best offer we will give it to them,"" Dutta said.

IndiGo is focused on growing its international routes and the plane order includes a long-range version of the single-aisle A320neo family, A321XLR which will provide the airline with ""a lot of growth"", Dutta said.

He said ordering widebodies was a distant dream for IndiGo and a part of its five-year plan but no decision had been finalised.

Dutta also said that a dispute between the airline's two promoters and largest shareholders, Rahul Bhatia and Rakesh Gangwal, was having no impact on the company.

""Both promoters are very much unified in their strategy for expansion. Let's grow fast, let's expand international, they agree with that completely,"" Dutta said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/replacing-pratt-engines-in-indigo-fleet-by-end-of-january-a-challenge-ceo-2022532,0.03,0.862,0.107,0.987

PARIS (Reuters) - The head of French jet engine maker Safran (PA: ) has voiced caution over the ability of aerospace supply chains to ramp up quickly after the return to service of the Boeing (NYSE: ) 737 MAX, which has been grounded for months following two fatal accidents.

Safran co-produces the LEAP engine for the MAX through its CFM International joint venture with General Electric (N: ).

Once the jet returns to service - the timing of which is in the hands of regulators - Boeing plans to reach a previously targeted production level of 57 aircraft a month by end-2020 from its current rate of 42, down from 52 before the grounding.

It has not offered further details on how fast output would rise.

Speaking to a group of reporters, Safran CEO Philippe Petitcolin noted planemakers like Boeing typically alter production in incremental steps of 5 aircraft a month.

""It is usually recommended to go up by 5 a month every 6 months, otherwise you can lose everyone (suppliers),"" he said.

He declined to comment directly on Boeing production plans, but his comments suggest the planemaker may not find it easy to reach 57 a month until 2021, even if the MAX is ungrounded this year.

Boeing's current plan implies output increases every four months instead of every six, a rate of change in the supply chain that Petitcolin described as ambitious.

Boeing said any production increases would occur gradually once deliveries resumed, ensuring the health of the supply chain and keeping production systems stable.

""We continue to assess production decisions and always work on plans with our suppliers,"" a spokesman said.

Not all suppliers are exposed to the same pressure. Some have continued to produce at 52 a month during the crisis in order to avoid kinks in production.

Once the grounding is lifted, Boeing has suggested it can deliver 70 MAX aircraft a month, matching the most it has delivered in any previous month.

The actual production rate in its assembly plant may depend on the degree to which Boeing decides to meet this goal directly from the production line or from the hundreds of aircraft now in storage, which have been built during the grounding.

Petitcolin said CFM would work hard to respond to whatever production rate Boeing deemed necessary.

It is also bracing for increased demand for LEAP engines from Europe's Airbus because of increases in CFM sales against rival Pratt & Whitney (N: ).

The two engine makers compete for airline contracts to power the Airbus A320neo, while CFM alone powers the MAX.

Pratt & Whitney has been hit by technical problems and recently lost two customers to CFM.

The original A320neo production plan assumed a roughly 50/50 split between CFM and Pratt & Whitney engines, but CFM has been asked to plan for an average of about 55%, executives said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/safran-ceo-cautious-on-supply-chain-once-boeing-grounding-lifted-2032840,0.063,0.896,0.041,-0.9137

(Reuters) - Shares of Boeing Co (N: ) and its global suppliers fell further on Tuesday as analysts began to tally the cost of the U.S. planemaker's decision to suspend production of 737 MAX jets in January, its biggest assembly-line halt in more than two decades.

Analysts estimated Boeing could continue to burn around $1 billion a month despite the halt in work on what was previously its best-selling plane, and investors worried layoffs, lost work and logistical costs would ripple through its supply chain.

The 737 MAX has been grounded since March after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months, costing the manufacturer more than $9 billion so far.

""Each supplier will likely be missing about 200 deliveries versus original plans, with about 80% of the shortfall coming in 2020 and the remainder in 2021,"" Melius Research analyst Carter Copeland wrote in a note.

Britain's Senior Plc (L: ), which makes parts including airframes and engine build-up tubes for the MAX, was one of the first suppliers to comment on the suspension, saying it was working closely with the U.S. planemaker to assess the impact of a production shutdown on its 2020 sales.

The fallout extended to carriers, with Southwest Airlines Co (N: ) extending cancellations of MAX flights by another five weeks through April 13, due to the continued uncertainty around the timing of the aircraft's return to service.

The U.S. planemaker's shares fell more than 1% in early trading, while its top supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (N: ), slumped nearly 3% to $75.65.

Analysts say the U.S.-based Spirit, which makes the MAX's fuselage, draws more than 50% of its annual sales from the plane.

""We assume (Spirit) will elect to stop production and furlough employees at a cost of $0.40 (per share) per month of the stoppage,"" Copeland said.

Spirit said it was working with Boeing to determine the financial implication of the production halt.

""We believe the suspension will likely last a minimum of 3-6 months but would not be surprised if it lasted longer,"" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Michael Ciarmoli.

Shares of Senior, whose aerospace unit counts Boeing as its biggest customer with 15% of the division's sales, fell more than 10%. Those in France's Safran SA (PA: ), which makes engines for the MAX in a joint venture with General Electric Co (N: ), dipped 1.5%.

Safran has warned that if the aircraft's grounding lasts until the end of the year, its cash conversion could dip below its targeted 50-55% range of recurring operating income.

Unlike most suppliers, it is paid mostly once the airplanes are delivered to the buyer.

GE has estimated the MAX grounding would reduce its cash flow by $1.4 billion in 2019. Its shares were down marginally at $11.16.

Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said there will be ""some step-down in production across the supply chain"", but he believes that Boeing will continue to absorb much of the financial impact and will keep its supply chain relatively supported.

United Technologies Corp (N: ), which makes landing systems, avionics and interior lighting for the MAX, and Arconic Inc (N: ) that supplies aluminum sheet and plate for the airplane dipped about 1%.

Shares of other suppliers such as wing flaps maker Ducommun Inc (N: ), composite materials supplier Hexcel Corp (N: ), and aircraft exterior lighting provider Astronics Corp (N: ) were down 0.5% to 4%. The three companies get about 10% to 15% of their annual sales from Boeing, according to analysts.

Other smaller suppliers, including Melrose Industries (L: ), whose GKN (LON: ) business has a contract to supply windows for the passenger cabin of the 737 MAX, and Meggitt (L: ), which makes parts including fire protection system for the MAX engine and auxiliary power unit, fell more than 1% in Europe.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/boeing-suppliers-slip-as-wall-street-counts-max-halt-costs-2043216,0.027,0.94,0.033,0.6188

SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE: ) Co's decision to suspend aerospace's biggest production line exposes contrasts in the U.S.-dominated 737 MAX supply chain, severely straining some niche machine shops while giving engine giants time to iron out their own wrinkles.

The temporary 737 MAX production halt, the latest fallout in a 9-month-old grounding crisis, has already kicked off tough negotiations between Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc , Boeing's largest 737 supplier, one industry source said.

Wichita, Kansas-based Spirit has staffed its factory with enough workers to maintain a pre-crisis build rate of 52 aircraft per month and to enable a smooth step-by-step eventual increase to 57 aircraft, the person said.

Now, furloughs in Kansas are likely if Boeing stops paying Spirit to build and store fuselages at those rates, the person said, adding that scenario was likely as Boeing looks to conserve cash. A second supply chain source agreed.

""No way can they keep going,"" he said.

Spirit declined comment.

A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on discussions with suppliers. He referred to a Monday statement that Boeing will work to ""sustain the gains in production system and supply chain quality and health made over the last many months.""

The fallout depends on how long Boeing's freeze lasts, and how much if any compensation Boeing pays to prop up some of the roughly 680 suppliers that feed its best-selling program.

Payments may not come quickly.

Planemakers rarely signal any intention to help the supply chain in advance, otherwise hundreds of healthy firms would demand compensation immediately, the supply chain source said. Instead, Boeing will assess impacts and may quietly help some companies bridge the gap until production resumes, he said.

Boeing will be caught in two conflicting pressures: the need to conserve cash, and maintaining its ability to ratchet production upwards once the MAX starts flying again - a goal behind Boeing's decision not to lay off any employees.

""The potential loss of talent, access to capital and incremental risk on the supply chain all create substantial uncertainty about Boeing's ability to increase production levels once the pause ends,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said.

MOM AND POP

About 80% of Boeing's closely guarded recurring costs in building the mature 737 - a figure that some sources place as low as $10 million per plane, a fraction of $40 million to $50 million estimated market value - involve payments to outside suppliers for parts.

Boeing said it does not disclose that ratio.

Big, diversified suppliers of systems like avionics and landing gear - like United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ) or Honeywell International Inc (NYSE: ) - will be relatively insulated because their revenue is spread across other Boeing and Airbus programs. They can also tap lucrative after-sales parts and repair services.

But providers of materials or structures, ranging from Spirit to a cluster of mom-and-pop machine shops in Washington state, where the 737 MAX is made, will be disproportionately exposed because those parts are sold once and rarely replaced.

One worried U.S. Pacific Northwest supplier quickly called a Boeing contact after headlines predicted output cuts.

""We are already under contract for parts,"" he said. ""We have already bought material, we already have labor into it.""

His factory has 16 weeks to deliver a part to the 737 factory in Renton, south of Seattle, and Boeing in turn has 90 days to pay. ""All of our costs are up front. We have a lot invested,"" he said.

The shutdown comes as the world's largest planemaker is urging suppliers to cut prices or give up a greater share of the after-sales market for parts and repairs - the focus of Boeing's own new services business.

One U.S.-based hardware supplier has watched its Boeing order backlog slide over the past six months, making 2020 sales forecasts difficult.

Engine-makers have a silver lining, however.

CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric (NYSE: ) Co and France's Safran (PA: ), makes engines for Boeing and rival Airbus. A slowdown for CFM means extra time to fine-tune new technology.

""That's good news for Airbus,"" one of the sources said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/boeing-737-max-freeze-divides-suppliers-into-haves-and-havenots-2043539,0.046,0.882,0.071,0.9097

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - A rise in large mergers and acquisitions (M&A) helped offset a plunge in cross-border deals in 2019, and many dealmakers say they expect subsiding geopolitical risk to embolden companies to pursue more tie-ups across regions in 2020.

The value of M&A globally totaled about $3.9 trillion in 2019, making it the fourth strongest year for dealmaking, according to preliminary figures published by financial data provider Refinitiv. This is only slightly lower than the $3.96 trillion in deals recorded in 2018.

Cross-border M&A totaled $1.2 trillion, down 25% year-on-year to its lowest level since 2013, as rising geopolitical uncertainty and regulatory scrutiny of deals made many corporate chiefs and boards wary of expanding beyond their home markets.

""Companies were more comfortable this year doing deals within their own regions given the macroeconomic risks such the trade tariffs and Brexit, so cross-border M&A was down,"" said JPMorgan Chase & Co (N: ) global M&A co-head Chris Ventresca.

Large deals, on the other hand, were on the rise, as companies were spurred on by their strong stock performance and cheap financing to pursue transformative acquisitions.

The number of M&A transactions worth more than $10 billion increased 8% year-on-year to 43 this year, their highest level since 2015, according to Refinitiv. Some 21 deals, each worth more than $20 billion, accounted for almost a quarter of global volume in 2019.

""Mega-deals were the main feature of this year's deal-making, especially in the United States, where the bulk of these transactions took place,"" said Goldman Sachs Group Inc (N: ) global M&A co-head Gilberto Pozzi.

The biggest deals of the year included U.S. drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's (N: ) $74 billion acquisition of Celgene Corp (NASDAQ: ); U.S. defense contactor Raytheon Co's (N: ) merger with the aerospace business of United Technologies Corp (N: ) into a $135 billion company; and U.S. pharmaceutical company AbbVie Inc's (N: ) $64 billion purchase of Botox maker Allergan Plc (N: ).

The United States accounted for close to half of global M&A volume in 2019, with $1.8 trillion worth of deals announced, up 6% from a year ago. Europe and Asia tied for a distant second, with a little over $740 billion worth of M&A transactions announced in each region.

""Europe has been hit by macroeconomic headwinds in key markets, including Britain, Germany and France, where Brexit uncertainty, slow growth and social unrest have been some of the main hurdles,"" said Pier Luigi Colizzi, Barclays Plc's (L: ) head of M&A for Europe and the Middle East.

In Britain, Europe's largest M&A market, dealmaking dropped 4% year-on-year to $220.6 billion, with much of the year dominated by political debate over when and how Britain will leave the European Union.

""Market uncertainty in the UK has played in favor of private equity funds, which have been very active and have carried out a number of take-private deals, including Merlin Entertainments, Sophos and Cobham,"" said Cyrus Kapadia, chief executive officer of Lazard Ltd's (N: ) British operations.

In Asia, China's economic slowdown led to M&A volume in the country dropping 14% year-on-year to $380.3 billion, while the political turmoil fueled by Hong Kong's pro-democracy turmoils unnerved dealmakers in the wider region.

ROOM FOR M&A TO PICK UP

After world stocks added over $25 trillion in value in the past decade, and a bond rally put $13 trillion worth of bond yields below zero, some investors have been asking whether a recession could be around the corner that would put the brakes on the wave of dealmaking.

Yet companies have not been holding back on M&A because of concerns about an economic slowdown, deal advisers say.

""The next economic downturn is not expected to be as severe as the 2008 financial crisis, and when it happens many well-capitalized companies may seek to capitalize on a drop in corporate valuations to pursue their dream deals,"" said Perella Weinberg Partners Chief Executive Officer Peter Weinberg.

The U.S. economy grew 2.9% in 2018, but forecasts for 2019 are for around 2.5% growth, due to the fading impact of U.S. President Donald Trump administration's tax-cut package and slowing global growth. At this level, dealmakers say the environment would be conducive for more transactions.

""A lukewarm economy is ideal for acquisitions, because companies need M&A to ensure growth, and business sentiment is sufficiently strong for CEOs and boards to be comfortable with pursuing deals,"" said Sullivan & Cromwell LLP partner Frank Aquila.

Moreover, some of the geopolitical risks that weighed on cross-border M&A in 2019 are gradually dissipating. The United States and China are close to signing their Phase 1 trade deal, while a strong electoral victory for Britain's Conservative Party earlier this month offered clarity on the country's timetable for Brexit.

""About a month and a half ago, activity levels started to pick up, and it seems people feel a lot better about the M&A pipeline,"" said Alan Klein, co-head of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP's M&A practice.

Despite the boom in dealmaking over the last few years, global M&A volumes are below their long-term average when viewed against the value of equity markets or global economic growth. Some deal advisers cite this to argue M&A volumes are not close to reaching a ceiling.

""In real terms, we have a good but not great level of M&A activity, with the potential for upside,"" said Citigroup Inc (N: ) global co-head of M&A Cary Kochman.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/dealmakers-eye-crossborder-ma-recovery-as-mega-mergers-roll-on-2050427,0.033,0.872,0.095,0.9959

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss

BOSTON (Reuters) - Two years ago, investor William Ackman, who pushes corporations to perform better, took his own advice and laid out a plan for a comeback after years of losses.

Over dinner at the New York Public Library, Ackman told investors in January 2018 that he was going back to basics by cutting staff, ending investor visits that were eating into his time, and hunkering down in the office to do research.

Now, Ackman has the numbers to prove his strategy is working.

The Pershing Square (NYSE: ) Holdings portfolio, the biggest at his Pershing Square Capital Management firm, returned a stunning 58.1% last year, making it one of the world's best performing hedge funds. It outpaced not only the benchmark S&P 500 stock index's 29% gain, but also the average activist hedge fund's 18.3% return, data from Hedge Fund Research shows.

Ackman has said privately he was going activist on himself to resuscitate his 16-year-old firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, after suffering double-digit losses in 2015 and 2016 followed by smaller declines in 2017 and 2018.

When Ackman next meets investors over dinner in February, he will be able to report that 2019 was his firm's best year ever. Assets stand at $7.4 billion and he will be able to charge performance fees again.

Despite his undisputed bragging rights, investors say they see a more humbled Ackman, who is sticking with the back-to-basics theme. He is staying out of the limelight while methodically searching for his next bets from new offices overlooking the Hudson River.

Ackman declined to comment.

If there was any secret sauce to last year's gains, it included patiently waiting for changes that Ackman had pushed for, often behind the scenes, to pay off, investors said.

Some big winners, including Chipotle Mexican Grill (N: ), which returned a whopping 72% over the last year with a new chief executive, have been in the fund for years.

Engagement at Starbucks (O: ), bought in late 2018 and up 40% in the last year, was out of the public eye. Even an investment in Automatic Data Processing (O: ), where Ackman lost a bitter proxy contest in 2017, paid off as Ackman and ADP Chief Carlos Rodriguez discussed potential changes over dinner.

Some investors also saw a changed Ackman when he exited his United Technologies (N: ) investment after sharply criticizing its planned merger with Raytheon Co (N: ). The money could be better invested elsewhere, Ackman said, after having privately mused that he previously had held on to soured bets in drug company Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: ) and Herbalife (N: ) for too long.

To be sure, many activists who - like Ackman - had bet portfolio companies would climb, got a boost from a booming stock market. Other firms, like Elliott Management and Third Point, that pursue activist investments plus a range of other strategies, delivered gains in the single- or low double-digits, their investors said.

It may be tough to repeat 2019 but Ackman has noted that Pershing Square has had five years of gains topping 36%.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ackman-avoids-limelight-even-as-pershing-square-posts-record-2019-2056019,0.044,0.853,0.103,0.9904

American Airlines (NASDAQ: ) stock fell 2.1%, Delta Air Lines (NYSE: ) stock fell 1.7%, while United Airlines (NASDAQ: ) fell 1.5%. China Eastern Airlines ADRs (NYSE: ) were down 9.8%, while China Southern (NYSE: ) ADRs (NYSE: ) ADRs were down 9.4%, reflecting the fact that the new virus appears to have originated in central China.

8:55 AM ET: Raytheon (NYSE: ) stock was down 0.6% and United Technologies (NYSE: ) stock was down 0.3%, after finding a buyer for two military GPS and radio location businesses that antitrust authorities have required them to sell in order to gain approval for their merger. The buyer, BAE Systems (LON: ) (OTC: ), rose some 3% after announcing the news in the U.K. on Monday.

08:50 AM ET: UBS (NYSE: ) stock was down 4.3% after the Swiss banking giant lowered its medium-term targets for profitability, citing headwinds from low interest rates.

08:44 AM ET: Walt Disney (NYSE: ) stock edged down 0.1% after the company said it will move up the scheduled launch of its Disney+ streaming service in the U.K. and parts of western Europe by a week. The service will now hit Britain on March 24.

The stock has rebounded in recent weeks as the market has been cleared of major sellers such as former CEO Travis Kalanick and early investor Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ).",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stocks--halliburton-uber-rise-in-premarket-boeing-lags-2063801,0.026,0.919,0.056,0.9485

(Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks looked set for further losses Tuesday as concern over the economic and human impact of China’s deadly coronavirus rattled global markets. Treasuries rallied and the yen held gains.

Futures pointed lower in Japan and Australia, which reopens alongside South Korea after a holiday Monday. Chinese and Hong Kong markets remain closed. The S&P 500 Index fell the most in almost four months with chipmakers, cruise lines and casino operators among the hardest hit as investors fled companies with close links to China. A gauge of U.S. equity volatility surged above its one-year average. The sank, breaching key technical levels.

Equity Pounding Feels Awful But Is Pretty Much Right on Schedule

Investor concern that China has failed to contain the pneumonia-like virus -- which has killed at least 80 people and infected more than 2,700 -- roiled markets at the start of a week jam-packed with corporate earnings. The outbreak shattered a calm in markets that hasn’t seen a 1% up-or-down move in the S&P 500 since early October.

Traders Eye Technicals to Predict Where Latest Stock Rout Ends

“This is now a sell first, ask questions later situation,” said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at Russell. “Markets hate uncertainty, and the coronavirus is the ultimate uncertainty -- no one knows how badly it will impact the global economy. China is the biggest driver of global growth, so this couldn’t have started in a worse place.”

China’s financial markets will remain closed until next Monday after authorities extended the Lunar New Year break by three days as they grapple with the virus crisis.

Elsewhere, oil slipped to a more than three-month low, had its longest slump since 2014 and iron ore tumbled.

Rare Inversion Points to Potential End of U.S. Equity Rout

Here are some events to watch out for this week:

Tech giants Apple (NASDAQ: ), SAP, Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Samsung (KS: ) and South Korean chip maker SK Hynix announce earnings, as do Boeing (NYSE: ), International Paper, GE, United Technologies (NYSE: ), Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ), Caterpillar (NYSE: ), Unilever (LON: ), Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ), Shell (LON: ) and Chevron (NYSE: ).

(NYSE: ), (NYSE: ), (LON: ), (NYSE: ), Shell (LON: ) and (NYSE: ). Fed policy makers are expected to open 2020 the same way they closed 2019 -- by holding interest rates steady Wednesday.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) will hold its first-ever Investor Day on Wednesday.

The BOE meeting is highly anticipated Thursday after a series of dovish comments raised speculation policy makers could lower interest rates.

The U.S. reports fourth-quarter GDP Thursday.

The U.K. is scheduled to leave the European Union Friday.

These are some of the main moves in markets:

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to post modest gains at the open Tuesday, rebounding a touch from Monday’s sharp losses. However, the tone remains one of caution and the sectors most exposed to the Chinese consumer are likely to stay weak.

At 02:05 ET (0705 GMT), the contract traded 83 points, or 0.6% higher. France's were up 33 points, or 0.6%, while the contract in the U.K. rose 36 points, or 0.5%. Futures on the pan-eurozone index, the , gained 24 points, or 0.7%.

All but six of those to die were in Wuhan, the city where the disease was first noticed.

Though cases of the virus have been confirmed in other countries, no fatalities have been reported outside China.

The Chinese government has sealed off entire cities, isolating some 50 million people in the region around Wuhan, in the hope this will curb the spread of the disease. Long-distance buses and some public transport networks have also been shut down.

“Equities are finally beginning to contemplate the possibility that the virus 2019-nCoV in China will have significant economic impact,” said Peter Garnry, Head of Equity Strategy at Saxo Bank Group.

“The most sensitive sectors to the Chinese coronavirus and potential economic impact are materials, energy, industrials, IT and consumer discretionary,” he added.

Turning to corporate earnings, SAP SE (DE: )will be in focus Tuesday after the leading provider of business software raised its revenue and profit outlook.

However, most eyes will be on Wall Street as Apple (NASDAQ: ) reports earnings after the bell, with many eager to see whether its latest slate of phones has revived sales. Additionally, three more components will issue results ahead of trading, namely Pfizer (NYSE: ), 3M (NYSE: ) and United Technologies (NYSE: ). Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) will join Apple in reporting after the close.

The U.K.’s , at 06:00 AM ET (1100 GMT) could be of some interest ahead of the Bank of England’s rate-setting meeting on Thursday.

(Reuters) - An AirBaltic A220 flight diverted to France on Wednesday because of an engine issue is the fourth reported case involving the Pratt & Whitney engine powering the Airbus jet, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said.

The A220-300 flight, traveling from Riga, Latvia, to Malaga, Spain, was diverted to Bordeaux because of a technical failure in the left engine, France's Bureau d'Enquêtes et 'Analyses (BEA) said on Twitter. The flight landed safely.

Airbus SE (PA: ) and United Technologies Corp, (N: ) maker of the Pratt PW1500G engines, confirmed in statements that they were aware of the flight and working ""to provide assistance"" as required.

The incident follows three emergency landings involving the GTF engine on Airbus's smallest jet, the A220.

""NTSB has accepted delegation for 3 previous incidents so NTSB will also look at the most recent incident,"" a spokesman for the U.S. government investigative agency said by email.

""NTSB is in the process of gathering initial data. It is still in the early stage of any investigation cannot make any conclusions at this time.""

Pratt & Whitney has said that a software update for the GTF engine on the A220 is expected in the spring, pending regulatory approval.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/diverted-airbaltic-flight-is-latest-case-involving-a220-engine-problems-2083441,0.036,0.905,0.059,0.6597

By Tim Hepher and Jamie Freed

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Competition is cranking up in the world of turboprops.

For years turboprops were an ignored corner of the aircraft industry, accounting for about 120 aircraft a year compared with the more than 1,000 jets made by giants Airbus and Boeing.

But growing rivalries in the turboprop business cut through a Singapore Airshow depleted by coronavirus this week.

While intercontinental jet travel is vulnerable to trade wars and disruptions such as epidemics, regional development in archipelago nations like Indonesia is favouring the turboprop.

The market has been dominated for years by Europe's ATR, jointly owned by Airbus (PA: ) and Italy's Leonardo (MI: ), which enjoys a relatively undisturbed lion's share of the market with a small slice also held by the Canadian-owned De Havilland 8.

But the commercial arm of Brazil's Embraer (SA: ) is sharpening a pitch to return to the market and Chief Executive John Slattery told Reuters he expected a decision by the end of the year.

""We should be positioned in the mid-to-late fourth quarter to bring a business case with a recommendation to our board,"" he said in an interview.

In a sign that the development is accelerating, Slattery said he had held talks with three potential engine suppliers - Rolls-Royce (L: ), General Electric (N: ) and Pratt & Whitney Canada, part of the engine unit of United Technologies (N: ).

""We are fully engaged with engine manufacturers now and meeting here at the air show...We are excited by where we are.""

Until now, planemakers have found it difficult to justify the estimated $2-4 billion investment needed to develop a new turboprop, despite its efficiency on relatively short flights.

The market has been stagnant at about 120 deliveries a year and demand for the planes is dependent on volatile oil prices, with turboprops displacing small jets when prices are high.

The thrumming noise of the propellor-driven turboprop also puts some passengers off, travel experts say, even though many in the industry say that reputation is already out of date.

Slattery said quiet new engine technology and advances in passenger comfort would stimulate demand.

""We believe the market opportunity going forward is significantly different to what past decades have shown.""

COMPETITION BOOST

China has already entered the fray with its planned MA700.

At ATR's bright-red stand inside Singapore's exhibition hall, Chief Executive Stefano Bortoli shrugged off the threat of a comeback by Embraer which already makes smaller turboprops.

""I think once Embraer will let us know their decision you will have our comments. At this point in time it is simply commenting on opinions. Not that we will stand still,"" he said.

The fundamental shape of the two-aircraft ATR family seating 40-78 people has not changed in about 30 years, but the aircraft was modernised with the -600 variant around a decade ago.

ATR recently launched a freighter and a version designed for use on short runways, which has opened opportunities in markets such as Japan and Papua New Guinea, where PNG Air emerged as a launch customer this week.

""The approach we've taken...is let's consolidate the platform that we have...and when the right time comes and there are solid options available, let's go for that,"" Bortoli said.

ATR shareholders have clashed in the past about whether to launch a bigger new 90-seater, with Toulouse-based Airbus blocking the investment. But industry analysts say ATR would have to consider responding to a new plane from Embraer.

The prospect of greater competition in turboprop adds zest to efforts by Embraer to complete a tie up with Boeing (N: ), which has agreed to acquire control of its commercial division.

The European Commission has extended its scrutiny of the $4 billion deal, fearing that it would narrow options for airlines.

Slattery reiterated Embraer would only have the appetite to invest in a new turboprop in the context of the Boeing venture.

He declined to elaborate but industry experts say it is a signal to Europe that the Boeing deal would improve choice for airlines by prompting ATR to come up with its own new product.

One European source said it remained doubtful whether Boeing would support a new turboprop once it gained control of Embraer, but analysts note the U.S. planemaker has not yet ruled it out.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/competition-heats-up-in-turboprop-market-2084139,0.048,0.87,0.082,0.9807

(Reuters) - Hedge fund Third Point LLC amassed a more than $2 billion stake in Prudential Plc (L: ) and called on the British insurer on Monday to split into two companies.

Third Point's demands, first reported by Reuters earlier on Monday, could lead to a major shake-up at Prudential, only a few months after it spun out its European insurance and asset management businesses into a new company called M&G Plc (L: ).

Third Point, which specializes in shareholder activism and is run by Daniel Loeb, wrote to the 332-year old London-based company on Monday to ask it to separate its Asian and U.S. businesses.

The New York-based hedge fund said Prudential's stock would benefit if it stopped running its crown jewel Asia business and its U.S. business, Jackson National Life, out of one holding company in Britain.

Jackson accounts for a small portion of Prudential's value, but is extremely complex to analyze, Third Point said. As a result, investors are undervaluing Prudential's Asia business because they are bundling it with Jackson, Third Point added. Moreover, the current structure is putting Prudential at a disadvantage when it comes to recruiting top talent in Asia, according to Third Point.

In the letter, addressed to Prudential's board of directors, Third Point also blamed the company's management for prioritizing dividend payouts over reinvesting in the business.

Third Point is arguing that some of the benefits of a split would include cost cuts at Prudential's British holding company, better capital allocation policies, and better management of the U.S. and Asia businesses, the sources said.

""If PruAsia and Jackson were separated, resulting in a greater focus on reinvesting capital in each unit and streamlining central costs at the group level, our analysis indicates that the interests represented by Prudential plc shares can double within three years,"" Loeb wrote in the letter.

Prudential did not respond to a request for comment.

While Prudential's headquarters are in London, it is regulated in Hong Kong following its separation from M&G.

A source told Reuters earlier this month that Prudential was studying options to reduce its ownership in Jackson, including seeking ""outside capital.""

Third Point's stake is equivalent to just under 5% ownership of Prudential, making the fund the company's second-largest shareholder and Prudential the hedge fund's biggest position currently, according to the sources. Prudential has a market capitalization of 36.8 billion pounds ($47.5 billion).

Third Point, which has $14 billion in assets under management, has experience in pushing companies to split themselves apart, including at Yum Brands, Dow Chemical (NYSE: ) and most recently United Technologies (NYSE: ).

To raise additional capital to build the stake in Prudential, Third Point raised a so-called special purpose vehicle, which allows hedge funds to raise money quickly and investors to put money to work in the stock of a specific company instead of a co-mingled fund.

Although Third Point is based in the United States, a significant portion of its recent activist engagements have taken place overseas, at companies including Sony Corp (T: ), Nestle (S: ) and EssilorLuxottica (PA: ).",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-hedge-fund-third-point-targets-british-insurer-prudential--sources-2092484,0.027,0.889,0.084,0.9843

FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE: ) on Thursday said it agreed to sell its elevators division to a consortium of Advent, Cinven ( ) and Germany's RAG foundation for 17.2 billion euros ($18.7 billion) in what could be the world's largest buyout this year.

The bidding group prevailed against a rival consortium comprising Blackstone (N: ), Carlyle (O: ) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year, Thyssenkrupp said.

The price, which makes the deal Europe's biggest buyout since 2007, beats the most optimistic estimates and roughly matches a bid that had been submitted earlier in the process by Finnish rival Kone (HE: ), which dropped out of the race earlier this month over expected antitrust risks.

Frankfurt-listed shares in the group (F: ) were up 4.8% at 1920 GMT.

Thyssenkrupp said it would reinvest about 1.25 billion euros to take a stake in the unit, which, based on the purchase price, would result in a 7.3% share that would be used to partially fund its pension liabilities.

""With the sale, we are paving the way for Thyssenkrupp to become successful. Not only have we obtained a very good selling price, we will also be able to complete the transaction quickly,"" Thyssenkrupp CEO Martina Merz said in a statement.

""It is now crucial for us to find the best possible balance for the use of the funds.""

The decision followed a meeting of Thyssenkrupp's management and supervisory boards, ending the closely watched saga.

SAFE SITES

By far the German conglomerate's most profitable business, Thyssenkrupp Elevator is the world's fourth-largest lift manufacturer behind United Technologies Corp's (N: ) Otis, Switzerland's Schindler (S: ) and Finnish rival Kone (HE: ).

The auction leaves Thyssenkrupp with a much-needed cash injection at a time when the once mighty group has accumulated roughly 16 billion euros in debt and pension liabilities, more than twice its current market value.

Pummelled by ill-fated investments, a downturn in the car market, multiple leadership changes and an overly complex group structure that was tackled too late, Thyssenkrupp's shares trade around 13-year lows.

As part of the deal, Thyssenkrupp Elevator will remain based in Germany and equal representation between shareholders and labour representatives will be safeguarded. Jobs and sites will be secure until at least March 31, 2027, union IG Metall said.

Thyssenkrupp will use the funds to cut debt, which will result in a significantly lower annual cash outflow for interest and pension payments, compensating for the loss of cash flow from the elevator business.

Funds will also be used to support Thyssenkrupp's other struggling divisions, including steel, plant building and car parts. The group will unveil exact plans for distribution in May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has approved United Technologies Corporation (NYSE: )'s planned merger with Raytheon (NYSE: ) Co, subject to conditions, the agency said on Thursday.

UTC agreed in June to combine its aerospace business with U.S. contractor Raytheon and create a new company worth about $121 billion, in what would be the sector's biggest ever merger. It won EU antitrust approval earlier in March.

To win U.S. approval, the companies agreed to divest Raytheon's military airborne radios business, including facilities in Indiana and Florida, and UTC's military global positioning systems, including a facility in Connecticut.

The businesses are to be sold to BAE Systems (LON: ) Inc or another buyer approved by the Justice Department.

The companies are the only Defense Department suppliers for military airborne radios and military GPS systems for air and sea, the Justice Department said.

The Justice Department said that the two companies were among the few companies that made components for certain military satellites, including those that warn of missile launches. Because of this, the department also required the companies to sell UTC's big space-based optical systems businesses.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/utc-raytheon-deal-wins-us-antitrust-approval-with-divestitures-2123048,0.005,0.804,0.191,0.9929

(Reuters) - Macy's Inc (N: ) will be removed from the benchmark S&P 500 stock index ( ), the S&P Jones Indices said on Tuesday, as coronavirus-induced store closures compound the retail sector's struggles with a shift to online shopping.

The company's shares have plunged more than 70% so far this year, leaving Macy's with a market value of $1.52 billion as of Tuesday's close, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

""Macy's has a market capitalization more representative of the small-cap market space,"" S&P said, adding that the company would become part of the S&P small-cap 600 index, effective April 6.

The pandemic has forced U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers, including Macy's Inc (N: ) and Gap Inc (N: ), to shut stores, furlough employees, withdraw forecasts and suspend dividends.

Macy's will be replaced in the S&P 500 by air conditioning company Carrier Global Corp .

Carrier was spun out last month by United Technologies (NYSE: ) in a bid to shed assets to complete its merger with Raytheon Co (N: ).

That deal is expected to close on April 3.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/macys-to-drop-from-sp-500-to-smallcap-index-2127254,0.038,0.914,0.048,0.3818

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing Co 's (N: ) grounded 737 MAX jet is expected to remain grounded until at least August as the manufacturer continues to grapple with software issues, people briefed on the matter told Reuters.

The largest planemaker has signaled it now hopes to win regulatory approval in August for the plane's return to service, but that could be pushed backed until fall, the sources said, as timing for meeting milestones is uncertain.

The best-selling airplane has been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people. Boeing halted production in January and has 400 undelivered MAX planes in storage.

Southwest Airlines Co (N: ), the largest operator of 737 MAX airplanes worldwide, said Tuesday it was removing the MAX from its schedule through Oct. 30 based on Boeing's ""recent communication on the MAX return to service date.""

Last week, Reuters reported that a key certification test flight had been delayed until late May at the earliest and reported in early April the company was dealing with two new software issues.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has repeatedly said it has no timetable for approving the plane's return to the skies.

Boeing declined to comment ahead of its earnings release Wednesday. On Monday, Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun during the company's annual meeting did not repeat prior guidance that Boeing anticipated the plane would win approval for a return to service in mid-2020.

""We remain confident in the MAX,” Calhoun said.

Boeing said on April 7 it needed to make two new software updates to the 737 MAX’s flight control computer.

One issue involves hypothetical faults in the flight control microprocessor, which could potentially lead to a loss of control known as a runaway stabilizer. The other issue could lead to disengagement of the autopilot feature during final approach.

Boeing said on April 7 it was working with Raytheon Technologies Corp (N: ) unit Collins Aerospace Systems on the software updates, but it remained unclear when Collins will complete work and how long it will take U.S. and other regulators to validate the fixes as they complete a software documentation audit.

Last month, Boeing decided to separate 737 MAX wiring bundles that regulators had flagged as potentially dangerous, Reuters reported.

In February, Boeing said it would need a software update to address a 737 MAX indicator light issue. In January it disclosed a separate software issue relating to a power-up monitoring function.

Boeing is also inspecting 737 MAX airplanes after it discovered foreign object debris in undelivered airplanes in February.

The Wall Street Journal had reported the 737 MAX return to service timetable.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/boeing-737-max-expected-to-remain-grounded-until-at-least-august-sources-2153776,0.064,0.887,0.05,-0.882

LONDON (Reuters) - Hackers posed as recruiters working for U.S. defence giants Collins Aerospace and General Dynamics (N: ) on LinkedIn (NYSE: ) to break into the networks of military contractors in Europe, cybersecurity researchers said on Wednesday.

The cyber spies were able to compromise the systems of at least two defence and aerospace firms in Central Europe last year by approaching employees with pseudo job offers from the U.S. firms, Slovakia-based cybersecurity firm ESET said.

The attackers then used LinkedIn's private messaging feature to send documents containing malicious code which the employees were tricked into opening, said Jean-Ian Boutin, ESET's head of threat research.

ESET declined to name the victims, citing client confidentiality, and said it was unclear if any information was stolen. General Dynamics and Collins Aerospace, which is owned by Raytheon Technologies (N: ), declined immediate comment.

ESET was unable to determine the identity of the hackers but said the attacks had some links to a North Korean group known as Lazarus, which has been accused by U.S. prosecutors of orchestrating a string of high-profile cyber heists on victims including Sony (NYSE: ) Pictures and the Central Bank of Bangladesh.

North Korea's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The attacks are not the first time LinkedIn has been caught up in international espionage. Western officials have repeatedly accused China of using fake LinkedIn accounts to recruit spies in other countries, and multiple hacking groups have been spotted using the business-networking site to profile their targets.

But ESET's Boutin said hacking attempts are usually conducted via email. ""This is the first case I am aware of where LinkedIn was used to deliver the malware itself,"" he said.

LinkedIn said it had identified and deleted the accounts used in the attacks. ""We actively seek out signs of state-sponsored activity on the platform and quickly take action against bad actors,"" said the company's head of trust and safety, Paul Rockwell.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/cyber-spies-use-linkedin-to-hack-european-defence-firms-2204705,0.096,0.855,0.049,-0.9628

(Reuters) - Maintenance firms and spare parts producers who keep airplanes running are bracing for a decline of up to 75% in sales this year - and more pain to follow - as airlines park or retire thousands of aircraft due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Worth about $80 billion in sales last year, the industry ranges from engine makers like General Electric Co (N: ) and Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (L: ) to systems companies like Honeywell International Inc (N: ) and Raytheon Technologies Corp (N: ) and a host of smaller suppliers.

Jetliners on average cost $3 million a year to service and make up a significant portion of revenue for most of these firms. That is under threat as the crisis cripples air travel and reduces the number of hours planes spend in the air, pushing back overhauls.

""We foresee reduction in maintenance, repair and overhaul demand of 60% or more for commercial aero engines (in 2020). And production will fall 40-50%,"" said Kevin Michaels, managing director at aerospace consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory.

""We will have an overhang of thousands and thousands of aircraft more than we require for years. To balance that out, you are going to have to retire thousands of aircraft.""

The decline of up to 75% in services revenue, which amounts to about $60 billion in lost sales, was estimated by analyst Richard Aboulafia at aerospace consultancy Teal Group.

Lower demand for new jets is also causing the industry to revisit projections for demand for services later on, as fewer jets come down the pipeline for future parts servicing.

Thousands of layoffs are already planned or under way but some aerospace experts suggest the impact is likely to be deeper than originally thought and point to several years of hard choices, with the market properly recovering only in 2023.

The International Air Transport Association said last week that airlines would lose $84 billion in 2020, with revenue down by half to $419 billion, the worst year in the sector’s history.

""This is going to be a very brutal time for companies dependent upon aftermarket revenues,"" Aboulafia said.

""The job cuts and spending cuts have only begun,"" he added. ""Generally, they need to fall as closely in line with output as possible, and output - of aircraft and spare parts - has only begun to be cut too.""

Some 18,000 planes, or around 65% of the global fleet, were grounded throughout April and most of May and the industry is now planning for a global recession and a future where business travel is reduced and holidaymakers stay closer to home.

Estimates collected by Reuters suggest the reduced demand will result in fewer than 20,000 planes in use in 2021 compared with an active fleet of about 27,000 planes in 2019.

All analysts with whom Reuters spoke said they did not expect maintenance spending to recover to 2019 levels until 2023.

Numbers on the current age of fleets, together with indications given by some airlines, suggest between 1,500 and 2,600 aircraft could be retired over the next 12 months, more than three times as many as in a typical year.

At $3 million a plane, that adds up to $7.8 billion in lost aftermarket revenue. But planes over 10 years old also tend to demand more work. They make up around 48% of the current fleet, but account for more than half the maintenance, according to consulting firm Oliver Wyman. So lost revenue is likely to rise.

""As aircraft are retired, aircraft operators will extract parts (used serviceable material) from retired aircraft rather than purchase parts from aftermarket suppliers,"" Credit Suisse (SIX: ) analyst Robert Spingarn said.

Costs per plane also vary drastically. A young Boeing (N: ) 737 may cost less than $1.5 million to maintain, while a widebody 777 or 787 four times as much.

Delta Air Lines Inc (N: ), in one example, is cutting 18 Boeing 777 planes which one analyst told Reuters cost $7.3 million each on average to maintain per year.

Timothy Kuder from consultancy Frost & Sullivan said airlines are likely to make ""significant"" job cuts once a moratorium on new layoffs under the government's bailout runs out in September.

""What that means for the companies reliant on aftermarket revenue ... (is) there is going to be less business out there than (parts suppliers) are able to sustain with their workforce.""

TOULOUSE/PARIS (Reuters) - French unions and a regional body slammed a decision by Airbus (PA: ) to cancel plans to bring some engine work in-house on Tuesday, saying it would cost 350 French jobs.

Airbus was due to take over production of some A320neo nacelles or engine housings from Raytheon Technologies Corp (N: ) this month, gaining access to future maintenance profits.

The plan dates back to 2017 when Airbus looked at ""in-sourcing"" two types of nacelle offered by France's Safran (PA: ) and what is now Raytheon Technologies, depending on the type of engine. It later decided to import only Raytheon (NYSE: )'s work.

But a public-private consultative body in the Occitanie region, where Airbus is based, disclosed that the plans had now been dropped altogether and said Airbus would instead prolong Raytheon's nacelles contract beyond end-June.

Coming days after France unveiled support for aerospace, the ""politically and economically untenable"" move means jobs will go to Mexico or China, Jean-Louis Chauzy, head of the CERER consultative body, said.

""The loss of capabilities will accelerate offshoring,"" he said, adding it would sour broader Airbus restructuring talks.

Force Ouvriere union said the move contradicted efforts to preserve high-tech employment.

Airbus said it had been forced to cancel the in-sourcing project due to the coronavirus crisis, which ""leaves Airbus with no choice than to revisit all current and future product development activities to protect our cash.""

Industry sources said the earlier decision by Airbus to import the work had partly been intended to spur suppliers to make concessions in a longstanding tussle over aftermarket profits.

But some had questioned whether it could develop the nacelles quickly and cheaply enough.

The cancellation may impact Spirit AeroSystems (N: ) which plans to buy the Bombardier (OTC: ) Belfast plant where thrust reversers for Airbus-designed nacelles would have been made. Spirit said planned acquistions were moving forward but not yet complete.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/unions-see-jobs-threat-as-airbus-scraps-bid-to-build-engine-parts-2210379,0.06,0.892,0.047,-0.7351

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chief executives of eight defense companies including Lockheed Martin Corp (N: ) and Raytheon Technologies Corp (N: ) have asked the U.S. government to ensure that billions of dollars are not taken from the Pentagon's budget to shore up firms hit by COVID-19 without being replaced with new funds.

Pentagon funds were given to defense companies to pay the salaries of highly skilled workers, preventing them from being laid off or poached by better-funded competitors.

At least several billion dollars will be needed to replace the funds to be spent on supporting the workforce and other coronavirus-related adjustments, the companies said in separate letters to the Pentagon and White House. One analyst estimates up to $15 billion could be needed. Both letters were seen by Reuters and confirmed by two of the companies that signed them.

The Pentagon has sought to make sure defense contractors do not lose highly skilled welders, laser engineers and other hard-to-find talent during the pandemic. It is also allowed to pay defense contractors for sick time or if healthy workers cannot get to job sites due to the coronavirus outbreak. These programs are aimed at maintaining a ""ready workforce"" among defense firms.

The Pentagon has sent a request for ""lower double-digit billions"" to the White House Office of Management and Budget to support defense industry claims to maintain a ""ready workforce.""

The letters signed by the eight CEOs said COVID-19-related workforce expenses are ""well beyond"" the Pentagon's ability to fund without significantly jeopardizing ongoing military modernization efforts.

The letters, dated July 7, were signed by the CEOs of Boeing Co 's (N: ) defense business unit, Textron Inc (N: ), L3Harris Technologies Inc (N: ), General Dynamics (N: ), Raytheon (NYSE: ), Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems Inc (L: ) and Huntington Ingalls Industries (N: ).

By Patricia Zengerle

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Defense Authorization Act, which sets policy for the U.S. Defense Department, is one of the only major bills to reliably pass Congress and be signed into law every year.

As lawmakers consider the $740 billion NDAA proposal for 2021, they are bracing for the possibility that President Donald Trump will veto what is usually viewed as a ""must-pass"" measure, over objections to renaming U.S. military facilities named after Confederate generals.

Here are a few things to watch for when debate begins next week:

SWAN SONG FOR SPENDING?

This year's NDAA could be the swan song for the constant expansion of the military budget, which has soared since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, except when reined in by mandatory spending caps.

Trump, with the help of the Republican-controlled Senate, has made boosting defense spending a top priority, using it to advance projects politically important to the president, including building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, deploying a new type of smaller nuclear bomb and creating a new branch of the military called the Space Force.

If Trump loses to former Vice President Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 election, or if Republicans lose control of the Senate, that could signal reduced spending in the coming years as Democrats look to boost funding for education, healthcare and other programs.

Regardless of the outcome of the Nov. 3 elections, the defense industry, companies including Lockheed Martin Corp (N: ) and Raytheon Technologies Corp (N: ), are expecting lower or flat defense spending in the coming years after a run up in recent years.

HOW WILL THE U.S. CULTURE WARS INFLUENCE THE PROCESS?

The proposed House and Senate defense bills both include language that would rename U.S. military bases named after former leaders of the pro-slavery Confederacy. The proposals have the support of Democrats and many Republicans, as well as leaders of the military, one of the most racially diverse organizations in the United States.

Trump has vowed to veto any bill that includes such language. As he campaigns ahead of elections on Nov. 3, Trump has backed the continued display of Confederate symbols and criticized protesters, even downplaying police violence against Black people.

Some Democrats also want the 2021 NDAA to end a program that gives military equipment to police forces and to bar the deployment of troops against civilian protesters.

WHAT ABOUT U.S. TROOPS IN GERMANY?

A rare point of contention arose between Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress last month when he announced plans to withdraw some 10,000 of the 34,500 U.S. troops in Germany, a major center for American forces since World War Two.

Trump has accused Germany of not pulling its weight as part of the NATO alliance.

Some Republicans and Democrats criticized the plan, saying that the U.S.-German alliance helps to counter the global international influence of Russia and China. Groups of lawmakers from both the Democratic-controlled House and Republican-controlled Senate want to include in the NDAA a measure that would bar Trump from lowering troop levels until 180 days after Pentagon leaders certify to Congress that doing so would not harm the interests of the United States or its allies.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/explainer-us-congress-readies-740-billion-defense-bill-covering-far-more-than-bullets-2231744,0.067,0.86,0.073,-0.7351

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - James Taiclet, the new chief executive at Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) the Pentagon's largest weapons supplier, is keen to use 5G networks to bolster the militaries' autonomous capabilities, he told Reuters in an interview following the company's earnings announcement on Tuesday.

Lockheed raised its full-year profit and revenue forecasts on Tuesday as the U.S. weapons supplier overcame coronavirus-driven supply disruptions in its aeronautics unit that makes the F-35 fighter jet.

The new CEO of the jet and missile maker told Reuters in his first interview since taking the job, ""in some ways the military application of 5G is simpler than the commercial application,"" he said.

He envisions a future where half to three-quarters of military vehicles are autonomous, and a robust 5G network is the backbone of that fleet.

""We're trying to make the programs and platforms better, and make them distinctively better versus our peer group by getting out in front of the networking side of this much more quickly,"" he said.

During a post earnings conference call with investors Taiclet gave the networking plan a name: ""I've got an idea called 5G.mil that we're going to try to figure out.""

Taiclet was head of American Tower Corp (NYSE: ), a real estate investment trust that leases out cell tower space to communications companies. He became CEO of Lockheed in June. He was previously on its board of directors.

He succeeded Marillyn Hewson, who held the top position at Lockheed for six years. She is now executive chairman of the board.

During his time at American Tower, the mobile communications industry grew and American Tower expanded its footprint both domestically and internationally through organic growth as well as acquisitions.

On the call with investors, Taiclet said he could explore acquisitions during an economic downturn.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge lower at the open Tuesday, with investors turning cautious as the earnings season kicks into high gear ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting while uncertainty still exists over new fiscal stimulus.

At 7:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), traded 15 points, or 0.4%, lower, down 64 points, or 0.6%. The contract fell 144 points, or 0.5%.

Senate Republicans on Monday proposed a $1 trillion coronavirus aid package, after securing agreement with the White House, paving the way for urgent negotiations with the opposition Democrats as expanded unemployment benefits for millions expire at the end of this week.

Meanwhile, the earnings season heats up, with this week set to see around a third of S&P 500 companies reporting.

Pfizer (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) have impressed with their quarterly results, while McDonald’s (NYSE: ) and 3M (NYSE: ) have disappointed.

The likes of Visa (NYSE: ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ), Amgen (NASDAQ: ), eBay (NASDAQ: ), Mondelez (NASDAQ: ) International and Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) are due to report after the bell.

The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee begins the latest of its regular two-day meetings later Tuesday. Expectations are for the to maintain rates near zero but there is speculation that the Fed may guide for a further relaxation of policy before too long.

Fed policymakers have become more downbeat on the economic outlook in recent weeks, with some cautioning that recent improvements in economic data such as job gains may be fleeting amid a resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic.

That said, there have been signs of improvement in the U.S.'s battle with the Covid-19 virus. New infections fell to their lowest level in nearly three weeks at the weekend, suggesting a slowdown beyond the normal weekend dip.

Economic numbers come in the form of house price data from S&P/Case Shiller at 7 AM ET, the Conference Board’s at 8 AM and the Richmond Fed’s regional business survey also at 8 AM.

Oil prices were largely unchanged Tuesday, with futures traded 0.3% lower at $41.46 a barrel, while the international benchmark contract rose 0.1% to $42.92.

Traders will be watching out for U.S. inventory data due from the industry group later on Tuesday and the on Wednesday.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary on Wednesday signed a declaration of intent to buy air defence missiles from U.S. arms manufacturer Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), Hungarian state news agency MTI reported, citing the defence minister.

The deal, worth about $1 billion, will be managed through the Foreign Military Sales programme and will be concluded by the end of September, MTI added.

Hungary has long vowed to increase its military spending, which as in many NATO countries remains far short of the alliance's goal of 2 percent of economic output. Much of its military infrastructure dates back to communist times.

It recently purchased tanks from Germany and is renewing its air capabilities as well, and Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government has put more focus on the military than most governments in past decades, when economic improvement was the priority.

Defence Minister Tibor Benko said things had changed.

""We see that the peace that we live in is an extremely vulnerable situation,"" he said, adding that extended beyond armed conflict into hybrid warfare such as in Crimea.

Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, was one reason why Western allies have criticised Hungary for its closeness with Moscow. Orban campaigned for Western sanctions against Russia to be eased.

Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto announced at a 2019 press briefing with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Budapest that the two countries were discussing the procurement of American air defence systems.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/hungary-commits-to-air-defence-missiles-from-raytheon-in-1-billion-deal-2263807,0.036,0.885,0.079,0.7968

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday as the good mood music created by U.S.-China trade talks and falling numbers of coronavirus cases in the U.S. was drowned out by the sound of an approaching hurricane and some ugly-looking consumer sentiment numbers

Hurricane Laura, upgraded overnight from Tropical Storm designation by the National Hurricane Center, is set to make landfall by Wednesday evening, and is set to disrupt the operations of major oil refineries in east Texas and Louisiana, some of which have already been shut as a precaution. So far, however, it appears unlikely that the storm will hit Houston, further west on the Gulf of Mexico coast.

Stocks came under pressure as the Conference Board reported an alarmingly sharp drop in its consumer confidence index for August. The index, which had been expected to rise to 93.0, instead fell to 84.8 - below even the lows registered in March and April. July's number was also revised down.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top aides to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo went before a congressional committee on Wednesday to defend President Donald Trump's dismissal of the former State Department inspector general as he investigated weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and allegations that Pompeo misused department funds.

Trump abruptly fired Steve Linick from the State watchdog position on May 15, as he probed the administration's decision to approve billions of dollars in military sales to Saudi Arabia despite congressional opposition.

Members of Congress had objected to the transactions, concerned they would exacerbate the huge humanitarian cost of the war in Yemen, possibly leaving U.S. officials vulnerable to war crimes charges.

""Did Mr. Pompeo fire (Linick) because he was getting closer and closer to matters that were embarrassing for Mr. Pompeo and his family… matters that implicated the State Department in a scheme to bypass Congress and sell lethal weapons that might be used for war crimes?"" asked Representative Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee.

Linick was one of five inspectors general - officials responsible for preventing government waste, fraud and abuse - fired under the Trump administration within six weeks. The firings prompted concern among members of Congress, including some of Trump's fellow Republicans, over whether Trump was interfering with legitimate oversight.

""The news of Inspector General Linick's firing did come as a surprise... Any time one is terminated, it naturally will raise some questions,"" said Representative Michael McCaul, the committee's top Republican.

However, McCaul noted that Inspectors general (IGs), like other executive branch officials, serve at the pleasure of the president.

Linick was also investigating allegations that Pompeo and his wife misused government resources by having department staff handle personal matters, such as picking up cleaning and walking their dog.

'LAPSES AND SHORTFALLS'

Three officials - Brian Bulatao, Under Secretary for Management, acting legal adviser Marik String and Clarke Cooper, assistant secretary for political-military affairs - testified.

Bulatao, a Pompeo confidant, insisted Linick's firing was not retaliation. He accused the longtime government official of a ""variety of lapses and shortfalls,"" including improper email practices and failure to complete an important audit on time.

Linick, who served as State IG for seven years, has denied wrongdoing.

Underscoring tensions between Congress and the administration over Linick's firing, Bulatao and String agreed to testify only after the panel announced subpoenas.

Wednesday's hearing lasted for more than three hours and often lapsed into acrimony, as Democrats attacked the department for refusing to cooperate. ""The Foreign Affairs Committee is investigating? Blow them off. Cancel their briefings. Call them names,"" Engel said.

Congress had requested an investigation into the Trump administration's May 2019 decision to allow $8 billion in military sales to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Jordan by declaring a ""national emergency"" over tensions with Iran.

Lawmakers had blocked many of the transactions for months out of concern the Raytheon (N: ) smart bombs and other equipment might contribute to the human catastrophe in Yemen, where bombings by a Saudi-led coalition have caused heavy civilian casualties.

A report issued by the IG's office in August found State did not fully evaluate the risks to civilians when it pushed through the huge precision-guided munitions sale, although it did not violate the law.",https://www.investing.com/news/politics/top-pompeo-aides-face-us-house-democrats-over-saudi-weapons-officials-firing-2297599,0.129,0.809,0.062,-0.9934

PARIS (Reuters) - French investigators have called for a review of the design and maintenance of titanium alloy engine parts to ensure they guard against the risks of metal fatigue following an engine blowout on an Airbus (PA: ) A380 exactly three years ago.

France's BEA agency made the recommendation in a final report into the accident in which an Air France jet carrying more than 500 passengers lost the front section of one of its four engines while flying over Greenland, before landing safely in Canada.

The move follows a perilous investigation involving a 21-month international aerial and ground search across the ice sheet to find a crucial titanium alloy fragment, buried 3 metres below the surface and just a metre away from a hidden crevasse.

The probe focused on the fan hub at the centre of a 3-metre-wide fan at the front of the engine made by Engine Alliance, co-owned by General Electric (N: ) and Pratt & Whitney (N: ).

The BEA said a recovered fragment had shown tiny fatigue cracks in a titanium alloy called Ti-6-4 and urged regulators - the Federal Aviation Administration and European Union Aviation Safety Agency - to carry out a review of design, manufacturing, maintenance and certification processes.

""Neither the manufacturer nor the certification authorities had anticipated this phenomenon in this alloy during the design of the engine,"" the BEA said.

Such recommendations by leading investigators do not have to be followed automatically but typically carry some weight.

Engine Alliance said it had already taken steps to address the findings. Airbus said no flaws had been found during inspections of other engines from the same supplier, one of two A380 engine manufacturers alongside Rolls-Royce (L: ).

A spokeswoman for Rolls said it was confident the issues associated with the Engine Alliance part ""cannot be attributed to any Rolls-Royce engine fan discs currently in service"".

Titanium alloy is used widely in aerospace, the metal's biggest customer due to its strength compared to the weight of each part, and its ability to handle high temperatures.

The industry has faced concerns in the past about titanium alloy manufacturing processes following an engine failure.

In 1989, a severe engine blowout on a United Airlines DC-10 led to the death of 111 people during an attempted landing at Sioux City, Iowa.

That crash sped improvements in manufacturing methods for titanium alloy. But some engine experts have rejected any suggestion that there is an industry-wide manufacturing issue.

During the operation in Greenland to find the missing A380 engine fragment, French, Danish and U.S. specialists battled problems from faulty generators to storms, buried tents and concerns about polar bears, according to an expedition report.

At one point, the team resorted to low-tech methods including bamboo sticks and concentrated juice to mark the snow after their high-precision positioning system failed, but the investigation also spurred development of new sensor equipment.",https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/france-urges-parts-review-after-airbus-a380-engine-blowout-2311862,0.085,0.86,0.056,-0.9568

TOKYO (Reuters) - Basing Japan's missile defence systems at sea may cost at least twice as much to complete as its now-abandoned plans for Aegis Ashore ground-based sites and delay it to 2028, a person with knowledge of the plans told Reuters.

Fitted with powerful Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) radars, Japan's Aegis Ashore systems are meant to intercept missile strikes from North Korea and elsewhere. In June, defence minister Taro Kono suspended plans for two land sites, which would have cost about $2 billion to construct, citing the possibility that booster rockets could fall on local residents.

Instead, he suggested installing the systems on sea platforms or ships.

Defence ministry officials are considering several proposals, including putting Aegis on platforms resembling oil rigs, or on converted merchant ships or naval vessels. Kono's successor, Nobuo Kishi, has said he will make a decision on the future of Aegis Ashore by year end.

Delays and higher costs could rekindle support for an onshore plan, as Japan's public finances are strained by debt exacerbated by massive coronavirus economic aid spending.

A defence ministry official said he was unaware of the new cost and time estimates for missile defence at sea. The land-based Aegis Ashore batteries were scheduled to be operational in 2025.

Some of those proposals could cost more than $4 billion each, not including interceptor missiles and operating expenses, which would exceed those of land stations because of fuel, maintenance and larger crews, said the person familiar with the matter, who has seen estimates being discussed by defence ministry officials.

The person declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the plans.

A destroyer has about 300 sailors, about 10 times more people than needed for a land site, according to Japan's defence ministry.

Armed with interceptor missiles designed to hit warheads in space, Aegis Ashore's Lockheed Martin SPY-7 radar has at least three times the range of older Aegis radars already on Japanese warships.

""We are here to support whatever Japan needs, and in our mind, there is no option that is off the table,"" said Tom Rowden, the vice president responsible for Lockheed's overseas Rotary and Mission System business, including Aegis Ashore in Japan. ""Our main focus here is to give Japan the capability that they need to be able to defend their country.""

In 2019, Japan listed China as its main security threat for the first time, pointing to Beijing's burgeoning defence spending and military manoeuvres. Japan has also said it is concerned about a resurgence in Russian activity around Japan.

Although Japan usually pays for big U.S.-built military projects through the U.S. government's Foreign Military Sales programme, it is buying SPY-7 directly from Lockheed and has paid half of the $300 million contract already.

The possibility that Aegis Ashore will be based at sea has spurred Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, which lost the contract to Lockheed in 2018, to promote its SPY-6 radar for Japan instead.

Defence ministry officials say they prefer the SPY-7 and are sticking with it. But some influential lawmakers from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, such as former deputy defence minister and deputy foreign affairs minister Masahisa Sato, favour SPY-6 because the U.S. Navy plans to use it on new Aegis Ashore destroyers.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/japans-plan-to-build-missile-defence-system-at-sea-faces-mounting-costs-source-2330442,0.04,0.897,0.064,0.7615

BEIJING (Reuters) - China will impose sanctions on Lockheed Martin (N: ), Boeing Defense (N: ), Raytheon (N: ) and other U.S. companies it says are involved in Washington's arms sales to Taiwan, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday.

Zhao Lijian told journalists that China was acting to protect its national interest, but did not spell out what form the sanctions would take.

The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of three weapons systems to Taiwan, including sensors, missiles and artillery that could have a total value of $1.8 billion, the Pentagon said last week.

Beijing considers Taiwan a wayward province it has vowed to bring under control, by force if necessary.

""To safeguard our national interests, China decided to take necessary measures and levy sanctions on U.S. companies such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing Defence, and Raytheon, and those individuals and companies who behaved badly in the process of the arms sales,"" Zhao said.

China has imposed sanctions on Lockheed Martin and other U.S. companies in the past for selling weapons to Taiwan, though it is unclear what form the penalties have taken.

The United States, like most countries, has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but Washington is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.

The Trump administration has ramped up support for Taiwan through arms sales and visits by senior U.S officials, adding to tensions in relations between Beijing and Washington, already strained by disagreements over the South China Sea, Hong Kong, human rights and trade.

A spokesman for Boeing said in an emailed statement that the company's partnership with China's aviation community had long-term benefits and that Boeing remained committed to it.

Lockheed Martin said in an emailed statement that all of its international military sales are strictly regulated by the U.S. government, and that its presence in China is limited.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Tuesday morning over rising tensions between the U.S. and China. The region followed the tumble in U.S. stocks as talks over the latest U.S. stimulus measures faltered and the Nov. 3 presidential election draws closer.

China’s was down 0.37% by 11:47 PM ET (3:47 AM GMT) and the inched down 0.04%. Tensions between the U.S. and China flared up after China imposed sanctions on U.S. companies, including Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ), Boeing Defense and Raytheon (NYSE: ) “in order to uphold national interests,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Monday. China's move comes as the U.S. contemplates a potential $2.4 billion sale of U.S. anti-ship missiles to Taiwan, potentially encompassing as many as 100 Harpoon Coastal Defense Systems built by Boeing (NYSE: ). The systems in turn include up to 400 land-based missiles.

On the economic front, Chinese authorities will set the nation’s next five-year plan through Oct. 29.

Hong Kong’s fell 1.30%.

Japan’s was down 0.33%. The Bank of Japan will announce its monetary policy on Thursday, with Governor Haruhiko Kuroda also due to deliver a briefing.

South Korea’s inched down 0.02% and in Australia the slid 1.72%.

House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were unable to reach a consensus on the measures with White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow saying that whilst differences between the two sides “have narrowed … [but] the more it narrows, the more conditions come up on the other side,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said.

“The challenge for markets is that in most cases they are already pricing a very strong economic bounce. The new [COVID-19] outbreaks, and the potential for a double-dip recession, directly contradict this [Kudlow’s] assumption,” CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy told Reuters.

The number of COVID-19 cases continues its incessant rise, with over 43.4 million cases globally as of Oct. 27, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

“The COVID-19 case news flow has clearly resonated … the reflation trade which was working so beautifully is being part unwound, not because of election repricing, but due to the new wave of COVID-19 cases,” Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a note.

(Reuters) - The United States' big technology names led gainers on Wall Street on Wednesday, as investors sought the security of this year's big stay-at-home corporate success stories in the face of a presidential election set to go down to the wire.

Overall, Wall Street's main indexes surged to a more-than-one-week high with the tech-heavy Nasdaq ( ) outperforming. ( )

Following are the major movers as traders and investors digested the results and President Donald Trump's chances of beating Democratic challenger Joe Biden to win a second term.

BIG TECH

Technology mega-caps have benefited from Trump's softer stance on regulation and anti-trust policies as well as a tax cut that targeted U.S. big business.

Microsoft (O: ), Intel (O: ) and IBM (N: ) rose between 0.4% and 2.2%, while FAANG stocks Facebook (O: ), Apple (O: ), Amazon (O: ), Netflix (O: ) and Google (O: ) surged between 3.2% and 7.5%.

""With a Trump presidency more likely than expected and a more evenly balanced Senate, any big change like higher capital gains tax or a legislation that regulates the tax more aggressively is less likely, and that's why tech is doing better,"" said TS Lombard's head of strategy, Andrea Cicione.

U.S.-LISTED CHINESE STOCKS

The iShares MSCI China ETF (O: ) scaled all-time highs, up 4.5% as a Biden administration is expected to ratchet down tensions in the U.S.-China tariff war.

Shares of Baidu (O: ) JD.Com (O: ) Alibaba (N: ) rose between 2.8% and 5.6%.

DEFENSE

The iShares US Aerospace & Defense (Z: ) and the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (P: ) extended gains to a third session.

Contractors Northrop Grumman (N: ), Lockheed Martin (N: ) and Raytheon (N: ) rose between 2.2% and 6.0% after the Congressional results so far suggest Republicans retaining control of Senate.

""This removes the threat of a Blue Wave, and 'progressive' Democrats attempting to take an axe to the Department of Defense budget to fund other spending priorities,"" said Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard.

PHARMACEUTICALS

Pfizer (N: ), Merck & Co (N: ), Eli Lilly (N: ), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (O: ), Bristol Myers (N: ) and Johnson & Johnson (N: ) all rose between 2.7% and 7.5%.

Analysts at SVB Leerink said a Trump win with a close Senate race was almost an ideal outcome for biopharma and that an effectively split Senate would likely shield the industry from any sweeping reforms.

(GRAPHIC: Trump vs Biden stock baskets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprxamgpe/Pasted%20image%201604092623457.png)

BANKS

Some of Wall Street's big banks slid, with JP Morgan (N: ), Bank of America (N: ) and Citi (N: ) down between 1.0% and 2.7% as market participants feared a divided Congress would make it harder for Washington to pass another coronavirus stimulus package.

""Now there will be a split Congress and, therefore, a lot more fiscal restraint and those expectations of higher inflation and high yields favoring banks and financials will have to be reassessed,"" Cicione said.

Wells Fargo (N: ), Goldman Sachs (N: ) and Morgan Stanley (N: ) managed to eke out gains, with Goldman up 2%.

ALTERNATE ENERGY

The Invesco Solar ETF (P: ) dropped 3.5%, having gained more than 40% from September lows, while the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (O: ), another instrument representing the developing sector, which Biden had made a key plank of his agenda, fell 2%.

""The fact that Republicans are likely to retain a Senate majority would make it virtually impossible for Biden (if he wins) to enact his major climate reforms,"" said Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov.

Stocks of solar energy firms such as First Solar (O: ), Enphase (O: ) and JinkoSolar (N: ) traded between 4.4% and 10.3% lower.

INDUSTRIALS

Shares of infrastructure companies such as Caterpillar (N: ), Vulcan Materials (N: ) and Jacobs Engineering (N: ) slid between 5.3% and 7.5%.

MARIJUANA

Major cannabis producers had surged after the vice presidential debate, when Biden's partner on the ticket Kamala Harris said marijuana would be decriminalized at the federal level under their administration.

But with exit polls surprising markets, the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (N: ) slipped 2.4%.

Shares of Tilray (O: ), as well as U.S.-based listings of Canada's Canopy Growth (N: ), Cronos (O: ) and Aurora Cannabis (N: ) fell between 9.4% and 7.8%.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/renewable-energy-pot-stocks-top-losers-as-election-results-leave-wall-street-hanging-2340413,0.018,0.883,0.099,0.996

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three U.S. senators said on Wednesday they would introduce legislation seeking to halt the Trump administration's effort to sell more than $23 billion of drones and other weapons systems to the United Arab Emirates, setting up a showdown with the president just weeks before he is due to leave office.

Democratic Senators Bob Menendez and Chris Murphy and Republican Senator Rand Paul will introduce four separate resolutions of disapproval of President Donald Trump's plan to sell more than $23 billion worth of Reaper drones, F-35 fighter aircraft and air-to-air missiles and other munitions to the UAE.

The huge sale could alter the balance of power in the Middle East, and members of Congress have chafed at the administration's attempt to rush it through, having sent a formal notice to Congress only last week.

Many lawmakers also worry about whether the UAE would use the weapons in attacks that would harm civilians in Yemen, whose civil war is considered one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters.

When the deal was announced, Amnesty International warned that the weapons would be used for ""attacks that violate international humanitarian law and kill, as well as injure, thousands of Yemeni civilians.""

The sale includes products from privately held General Atomics, Lockheed Martin Corp (N: ) F-35s and missiles made by Raytheon (N: ).

SALES' FATE UNCERTAIN

While the resolutions bring attention to lawmakers' questions about the massive sales, and could delay them, they are unlikely to stop them.

U.S. law covering major arms deals lets senators force votes on resolutions of disapproval. However, to go into effect the resolutions must pass the Republican-led Senate, which rarely breaks from Trump. They also must pass the Democratic-led House of Representatives and survive Trump vetoes.

But incoming President Joe Biden could ultimately stop them for reasons of national security, making a prediction on the final outcome difficult.

The senators said the Trump administration, seeking to rush the sale as it brokered a peace deal between the UAE and Israel, circumvented the normal review process. They said State and the Pentagon failed to respond to their inquiries.

Weaponry involved includes the world's most advanced fighter jet, more than 14,000 bombs and munitions and the second-largest sale of U.S. drones to a single country.

The Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees have the right to review and attempt to block weapons sales.

Past measures to block arms sales over concerns about Yemeni casualties passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support, but failed to get enough Republican backing to override Trump's vetoes.

Lawmakers have also expressed concern about whether the UAE sales would violate a longstanding agreement with Israel that any U.S. weapons sold in the Middle East would not impair its ""quantitative military edge"" over neighboring states.

Menendez is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and in line to become chairman next year if Democrats take control of the Senate in Georgia runoff elections in January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Joe Biden will come under immense pressure from progressives in the Democratic party to cut the defense budget once he takes office in January.

But defense spending is unlikely to be cut since it supports countless U.S. jobs during the coronavirus recession.

In three years, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has increased defense spending 19% from $619.5 billion to $740 billion.

Progressive (NYSE: ) Democrats in U.S. House of Representatives have called for a reduction in military spending to combat the coronavirus.

""Even if Democrats end up taking the Senate, I don't think they'll want to start putting in cuts for defense right away,"" said Todd Harrison the director of Defense Budget Analysis at Center for Strategic and International Studies adding, ""because we'll still be in, or slowly emerging from, this recession.""

Harrison said sudden changes could mean job losses in the lead up to mid-term elections. The possibility of cutting defense jobs could hurt vulnerable Democrats seeking reelection at a time when their majority in the House is already razor thin.

For that reason deep defense cuts may not be popular with many moderate Democrats either, a former Pentagon official added. The economic impacts of a weapons order are far-flung. Experts say https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arms-jobs-exclusive/exclusive-defense-firms-see-only-hundreds-of-new-u-s-jobs-from-saudi-mega-deal-idUSKCN1N40DM each defense job often indirectly contributes to three or four additional jobs in a community, making them the type of jobs politicians will go out of their way to protect.

The defense industry also does not see lower budgets any time soon. Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Chief Financial Officer Toby O'Brien told Reuters following their recent earnings announcement, ""You are kind of looking at 2022-ish time frame if there were to be a downward adjustment.""

The Pentagon's own budget projections ""would be relatively flat through 2025, averaging about $707 billion per year in 2021 dollars,"" the Congressional Budget Office said in a September analysis.

The deep ties to the defense industry of current candidates to become Secretary of Defense also suggests radical cuts are unlikely.

Michele Flournoy, a former top U.S. Department of Defense official has a deep history inside the Beltway working with defense contractors, including a current stint on the board of Booz Allen (NYSE: ) Hamilton.

Another contender, former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, sits on the board of defense contractor Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) Co.

If a smaller budget were adopted, the first items any administration would put on the chopping block include Army troop levels and the number of multi-billion dollar Navy aircraft carrier groups deployed.

That assessment came out of a mid-October, Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments/Ronald Reagan Institute exercise where a bipartisan group including staff from Capitol Hill and former Pentagon officials who will influence a Biden administration envisioned those cuts if smaller budgets came to pass, people familiar with the exercises said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/biden-will-struggle-to-cut-defense-spending-despite-pressure-2356259,0.088,0.828,0.084,-0.9022

WASHINGTON/WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - President-elect Joe Biden has chosen retired General Lloyd Austin, who oversaw U.S. forces in the Middle East under President Barack Obama, to be his defense secretary, two people familiar with the decision said on Monday.

Austin, who would be the first Black U.S. secretary of defense, was a surprise pick over Michele Flournoy, a former top Defense Department official who was considered the leading contender for the job. Flournoy would have been the first woman defense secretary.

The news was first reported by Politico.

Austin, who retired in 2016, will need a waiver from Congress since it has been less than the required seven years since he served. He would be the second Pentagon chief in four years to need a waiver, after President Donald Trump picked James Mattis, a retired Marine general, to be his first defense secretary.

The nomination of Austin, who headed U.S. Central Command under Obama, could draw fire from some progressive groups given his role in retirement on the board of a number of companies, including weapons maker Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp.

But Biden and Austin developed a working relationship during the Obama administration and the retired general has been advising the transition team on national security issues, one of the people familiar with the decision to name him said.

Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, on Monday also announced key members of his health team to lead the administration's response to the raging coronavirus pandemic.

Biden chose California Attorney General Xavier Becerra for secretary of health and human services and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, to run the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was named as Biden's chief medical adviser on the virus.

Biden's first major challenge in the White House will be containing a resurgent COVID-19 virus that has killed more than 283,000 Americans, and finding ways to jump-start an economy still reeling from millions of pandemic-fueled job losses.

He installed Jeff Zients, an economic adviser https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2II2BN known for his managerial skills, as coronavirus ""czar"" to oversee a response that will include an unprecedented operation to distribute hundreds of millions of doses of a new vaccine, coordinating efforts across multiple federal agencies.

""This team of world-class medical experts and public servants will be ready on Day One to mobilize every resource of the federal government to expand testing and masking,"" Biden said in a statement, adding they would ""oversee the safe, equitable, and free distribution of treatments and vaccines.""

DIVERSITY PUSH

Biden's choice of Becerra, 62, a Latino former congressman, adds a politician to a health effort that otherwise largely relies on government administrators and health experts.

The choice also comes as Biden faces pressure to ensure diversity in his Cabinet appointments, including complaints from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus about the number of Latinos and from civil rights groups about the lack of Black nominees.

Biden's decision to nominate the first Black defense secretary in Austin helps him make good on his diversity promise. It also will resonate among proponents for greater diversity in the leadership of the U.S. armed forces, which is regularly criticized for failing to promote Black servicemembers and whose top tier has been largely white.

Austin has not cultivated a public persona and is not seen as someone who enjoys the media spotlight. However, he is known to be a shrewd military strategist with deep knowledge of the U.S. armed forces.

Earlier on Monday, the Democrat who leads the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Adam Smith, had openly shown his preference for Flournoy. ""I think Michelle Flournoy is hands-down the best-qualified person to do the job,"" Smith said.

But David Segal, executive director of the progressive group Demand Progress, said Austin was a better choice given his role presiding over drawdowns of forces from Iraq and Afghanistan.

And while he had some concerning ties to major companies like Raytheon (NYSE: ), they were not as broad in scope as those of Flournoy. ""He doesn't seem to have a web of entanglements that are as opaque and dense as hers,"" Segal told Reuters.

Biden, a Democrat, has pressed ahead with the transition to the White House even as Trump, a Republican, refuses to concede the Nov. 3 election and wages a foundering effort to overturn the results with unsubstantiated claims of fraud.

Dozens of Trump's legal challenges have been rejected by the courts, the latest on Monday when judges in Detroit and Atlanta tossed bids to decertify Biden's election victories in Michigan and Georgia. Biden won Michigan by about 154,000 votes and Georgia by about 12,000 votes.

In Georgia, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Monday certified the state's results, a statement said, after a third count confirmed Biden's win. The Electoral College will formalize results nationwide on Dec. 14.

Raffensperger, a Republican, said continued debunked claims about voting fraud were ""hurting our state."" Runoff elections for Georgia's two U.S. Senate seats, scheduled for Jan. 5, will determine which party controls the chamber.",https://www.investing.com/news/coronavirus/biden-picks-becerra-as-health-secretary-as-he-builds-team-to-battle-covid19-2363160,0.058,0.849,0.092,0.969

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An effort to stop President Donald Trump's high-tech weapons deals with the United Arab Emirates fell short on Wednesday in the U.S. Senate as Trump's fellow Republicans opposed resolutions of disapproval seeking to block the sale of drones and advanced F-35 fighter jets.

The Senate voted 50-46 and 49-47, mostly along party lines, to stop consideration of the resolutions, killing them at least until President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.

Biden, a Democrat, is expected to review the sales.

Early on Wednesday, the Trump administration had issued a formal notice of its intention to veto the measures if they passed the Senate and House of Representatives.

The White House said the sales support U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives by ""enabling the UAE to deter increasing Iranian aggressive behavior and threats"" in the wake of its recent peace deal with Israel.

Backers of the sale also described the UAE as an important U.S. partner in the Middle East.

The two weapons packages are a major component of a planned $23 billion sale of high-tech armaments to the UAE. Opponents said the transactions were being rushed through, without sufficient assurances that the equipment would not fall into the wrong hands or fuel instability in the Middle East.

Some U.S. lawmakers also criticized the UAE for its involvement in the war in Yemen, a conflict considered one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters.

The administration told Congress in November it had approved the massive sale to the UAE of products from General Atomics, Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp.

Some lawmakers also worried that the weapons transfers might violate U.S. guarantees that Israel will retain a military advantage in the region. But Israel, which enjoys strong support in Congress, has said it does not object to the sales.

Accusing Trump of cutting short or sidestepping Congress' typical review of major weapons sales, lawmakers have tried repeatedly during Trump's four-year presidency to block his plans for arms sales.

None of the efforts succeeded, either dying in the Republican-led Senate or, if passed, failing to win the two-thirds majorities in the Senate and House to override Trump's vetoes.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trump-issues-formal-threat-to-veto-effort-to-block-massive-uae-arms-sales-2365331,0.11,0.806,0.084,-0.7444

(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Third Point (NYSE: ) LLC is pushing Intel Corp (NASDAQ: ) to explore strategic alternatives, including whether it should keep chip design and production under one roof, according to a letter it sent to the company's chairman on Tuesday that was reviewed by Reuters.

Were it to gain traction, Third Point's push for changes could lead to a major shakeup at Intel, which has been slow to respond to investor calls to outsource more of its manufacturing capacity. It could also lead to the unwinding of some of its acquisitions, such as the $16.7 billion purchase of programmable chip maker Altera in 2015.

Third Point Chief Executive Daniel Loeb wrote to Intel Chairman Omar Ishrak calling for immediate action to boost the company's position as a major provider of processor chips for PCs and data centers. The New York-based fund has amassed a nearly $1 billion stake in Intel, according to people familiar with the matter.

Intel shares rose 6.1% to $49.95, the most in more than eight months on the news, giving the company a market value of more than $200 billion. The stock had declined about 21% this year, compared with a 43% rise in the Index.

Intel's most urgent task was addressing its ""human capital management issue,"" as many of its talented chip designers have fled, ""demoralized by the status quo,"" Loeb wrote in the letter.

Intel has lost its pole position in microprocessor manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and South Korea's Samsung Electronics (OTC: ) Co Ltd, Loeb wrote in the letter.

Intel is also losing market share in its core PC and data center markets to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) Inc, Loeb added. NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: ) is dominating computational models used in artificial intelligence applications, while Intel has been largely absent in this nascent market, according to the letter.

""Without immediate change at Intel, we fear that America's access to leading-edge semiconductor supply will erode, forcing the U.S. to rely more heavily on a geopolitically unstable East Asia to power everything from PCs to data centers to critical infrastructure and more,"" Loeb wrote.

In a short statement, the Santa Clara, California-based company said, ""Intel welcomes input from all investors regarding enhanced shareholder value. In that spirit, we look forward to engaging with Third Point LLC on their ideas towards that goal.""

Loeb asked Intel to retain an investment adviser to evaluate strategic alternatives, including whether it should remain an integrated device manufacturer and the potential divestment of failed acquisitions, according to the letter. Third Point believes that Intel should consider separating its chip design from its semiconductor fabrication plant manufacturing operations, according to the sources. This could include a joint venture in manufacturing, according to sources.

Intel customers, such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ), are developing their own in-house silicon solutions and sending those designs to be manufactured in East Asia, Loeb wrote. He suggested Intel must offer new solutions to retain these customers rather than have them send their manufacturing away.

Third Point, which has $15 billion in assets under management, has experience in pushing companies to pursue deals, including at Prudential (NYSE: ) Plc, Yum! Brands Inc (NYSE: ), Dow Chemical and United Technologies (NYSE: ). The firm's Third Point Offshore fund was up 19.9% for the year through the middle of December, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Loeb said in the letter that Third Point reserved the option to submit nominees for election to Intel's board at its next annual meeting, should it sense ""a reluctance to work together to address the concerns"" it raised.

OUTSOURCING MANUFACTURING

The COVID-19 pandemic has given Intel a boost in the form or surging laptop sales, as employees and students work and learn from home. But the company has failed to capitalize on strong demand for semiconductors more broadly, needed to power everything from smartphones to artificial intelligence.

This is because Intel's in-house manufacturing capabilities have often struggled with the customized chips its clients want. The ability of its rivals to use a wide network of suppliers also results in many of its offerings lagging its rivals in speed and energy consumption.

Splitting its design and manufacturing operations could help it produce better chips at a lower cost by tapping outside vendors to make its most advanced central processors, a step executives have long resisted.

But selling Intel's factories, or even opening them up more to contract manufacturing, could pose a challenge because they are geared toward its own design process, rather than broader industry standards that other companies follow.

U.S. national security concerns could present another obstacle to a potential divestment. Intel's most formidable manufacturing rivals - TSMC and Samsung (KS: ) - have their manufacturing base overseas, and it is unclear whether regulators would approve a sale of any of Intel's chipmaking operations to a foreign entity, given its central role in the supply chain.

Intel named its former chief financial officer, Bob Swan, chief executive last year. In June, it lost one of its veteran chip designers, Jim Keller, over a dispute on whether the company should outsource more of its production, sources said at the time.",https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/exclusive-hedge-fund-third-point-urges-intel-to-explore-deal-options-2376931,0.044,0.892,0.064,0.914

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Short bets on Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc were the most unprofitable trade in 2020, as the electric automaker saw its shares surge over 740% en route to becoming the world's most valuable automaker.

In a note to clients, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, said mark-to-market short losses for Tesla totaled over $40 billion, as it was ""far and away the most unprofitable trade in 2020 and had the largest yearly loss we have seen historically.""

Overall, shorts were down $245 billion, net of financing, in 2020 as the and Nasdaq rallied back from pandemic selling early in the year to near record highs as 2020 was closed out.

Investors who sell securities ""short"" borrow shares and then sell them, expecting the stock to fall so they can buy the shares back at the lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.

Dusaniwsky noted that most of the most unprofitable shorts of 2020 were technology or ""stay at home"" plays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) was the next most unprofitable short play at about $6.7 billion in losses.

Rounding out the top five were Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ) at $5.8 billion, U.S. listed shares of Pinduoduo (NASDAQ: ) Inc at $4.8 billion and Square Inc (NYSE: ) at $4.7 billion.

On the flip side, there were only five short positions that drew over $1 billion in mark-to-market profits, according to S3. The top short play was Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ) as the oil major slumped more than 40% in 2020 in large part due to a plunge in oil prices caused mainly by a lack of demand during the pandemic.

Only four other short positions topped over $1 billion according to S3 - AT&T Inc (NYSE: ), Raytheon (NYSE: ) Co, which was acquired by United Technologies in April to become Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, U.S.-listed shares of Luckin Coffee (OTC: ) Inc and Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) & Co.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tesla-bears-suffer-record-shortsale-loss-in-2020-s3-partners-2395559,0.031,0.891,0.079,0.9553

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Friday voted overwhelmingly to confirm retired Army General Lloyd Austin as President Joe Biden's defense secretary, making him the first Black American to serve in the role.

The vote was 93-2 in the 100-member chamber, far more than the simple majority needed.

Lawmakers from both parties said they were pleased that Austin would be installed to lead the Pentagon just two days after Biden was sworn in as president.

After a smooth transition to Biden's new administration was impeded by former Republican President Donald Trump's insistence that he had won the Nov. 3 election, Biden's fellow Democrats - and some Republicans - have been pushing to confirm the new president's national security team as quickly as possible.

Senator Jack Reed, the incoming Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, noted the wide range of challenges facing the country - including the coronavirus pandemic and competition with China and Russia.

""General Austin is an exceptionally qualified leader with a long and distinguished career in the U.S. military,"" Reed said before the vote.

""We have China and Russia out there with capabilities that we didn't really believe we would find ourselves with,"" said Senator James Inhofe, the outgoing Republican chairman of the armed services panel, also urging support for Austin.

Members of Congress on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a waiver allowing Austin to lead the Pentagon even though he had not cleared the required seven-year waiting period since leaving the uniformed services - a law intended to guarantee civilian control of the military.

PRIVATE MAN

Austin, 67, built a reputation as a razor-sharp leader who avoided the spotlight during his distinguished four-decade career in uniform, including time heading Central Command, which oversees U.S. troops across the Middle East.

He retired from the army in 2016.

Austin had a smooth Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday. Two weeks after rioters, some identified as white supremacists, stormed the Capitol in opposition to Trump's election defeat, Austin said he would work to get rid of ""racists and extremists"" from the military's ranks.

Officials have expressed dismay that several of those arrested and charged - some of whom used military tactics - have served in the armed forces.

Republican Senators Mike Lee and Josh Hawley were the only ones to vote against Austin's confirmation. Aides to the two senators did not immediately respond to requests for an explanation of their votes.

Hawley was involved in a Republican effort to block the certification of Biden's election victory. Some Democrats have called for an ethics investigation of his conduct in light of the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters as Congress certified the results.

Lee was not part of the effort to block the certification.

Austin's nomination also prompted questions about his former position on the board of defense contractor Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp . Austin has pledged to fully divest from Raytheon (NYSE: ) within 90 days of his confirmation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration has temporarily paused some pending arms sales to U.S. allies in order to review them, a U.S. State Department official said on Wednesday.

Reviews of this sort are typical for a new administration, but Donald Trump's administration was doing deals down to the wire, including one for 50 stealthy F-35 jets made by Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) as a side deal to the Abraham accords inked only moments before Biden was sworn into office.

The Department is temporarily pausing the implementation of some pending U.S. defense transfers and sales under Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial Sales to allow incoming leadership an opportunity to review, the official said.

The F-35 jets are a major component of a $23 billion sale of high-tech armaments from General Atomics, Lockheed and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp to the United Arab Emirates.

On a post-earnings conference call with investors on Tuesday, Raytheon (NYSE: )'s management said ""with the change in administration, it becomes less likely that we're going to be able to get a license"" for a direct commercial sale of offensive weapons worth about $500 million to a Middle East customer. Raytheon did not give the name of the customer.

""The UAE will work closely with the Biden administration on a comprehensive approach to Middle East peace and stability,"" the UAE ambassador to the United States, Yousef Al Otaiba, said in a statement posted on the Embassy Twitter account.

""The F-35 package is much more then selling military hardware to a partner, Like the US, it allows the UAE to maintain a strong deterrent to aggression.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the first potential sales of weapons under the Biden administration, including communications equipment for NATO and missiles for Chile, in deals with a combined value up to $150 million, the Pentagon said on Friday.

The sales are the first foreign military sales to be announced since U.S. President Joe Biden took office, but since sales take months to process, the genesis of the deals likely dates back to the Trump administration.

Since taking office, the Biden administration temporarily paused some pending arms sales to U.S. allies like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in order to review them, despite having been approved by the Trump administration.

The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the possible sales to Chile and NATO on Friday.

The NATO Communications and Information Agency package includes 517 AN/PRC-158 Manpack UHF SATCOM radio systems for field communications, with an estimated cost of up to $65 million, including training and spares.

Separately, Chile could buy as many as 16 Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) Block IIIA missiles, supporting equipment, spares and training for $85 million, the Pentagon said. SM-2 missiles are considered medium-range and are often used by ships against enemy aircraft.

Despite approval by the State Department, the notification does not indicate that a contract has been signed or that negotiations have concluded.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Antitrust regulators will likely lengthen their investigation into Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: )'s proposed purchase of rocket maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE: ) Inc, industry executives said, since the deal would give the No. 1 defense contractor ownership of a vital piece of the U.S. missile industry.

The $4.4 billion dollar deal, announced late last year, has raised eyebrows because Lockheed would take over a company that produces 70% of the solid fuel rocket motors and other propulsion products used in everything from antiballistic missiles, to air-to-air missiles.

On Thursday the chief executive of one of Aerojet's biggest customers, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, said his company would speak with anti-trust regulators because they have ""concerns"" about the deal.

""If that merger actually happens, you don't have an independent supplier in the solid rocket motor side,"" Greg Hayes said at the Barclay's Industrial Select Conference on Wednesday. Hayes said, ""we're going to make our concerns known to [antitrust enforcers]and the Department of Defense, and we'll see how this whole thing plays out."" The Federal Trade Commission is reviewing the deal for the government, the people said.

Lockheed competes against Raytheon (NYSE: ) when it sells tactical missiles, often fired from jets, to the Pentagon.

Lockheed's CEO, Jim Taiclet, said the deal could put Lockheed into a strong position in the growing propulsion and hypersonic weapons market.

Still, Taiclet has said Lockheed would simultaneously remain a partner to Aerojet's current customer base by ""providing outstanding propulsion products for the entire industry.""

The merger, announced on Dec. 20, is in its 60-day antitrust review period that expires at midnight Thursday and is widely expected be extended by the FTC, allowing the agency more time for review.

Lockheed has anticipated the deal could take until the second half of the year to close.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-antitrust-enforcers-seen-extending-review-of-lockheeds-deal-for-aerojet-2421951,0.024,0.917,0.059,0.8074

(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE: ) Co said it recommended suspending the use of 777 jets with the same type of engine that shed debris over Denver at the weekend after U.S. regulators announced extra inspections and Japan suspended their use while considering further action.

The moves involving Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines came after a United Airlines 777 landed safely in Denver on Saturday local time after its right engine failed.

United said the next day it would voluntarily and temporarily remove its 24 active planes, hours before Boeing's announcement.

Boeing said 69 of the planes were in service and 59 were in storage, at a time when airlines have grounded planes due to a plunge in demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

The manufacturer recommended airlines suspend operations until U.S. regulators identified the appropriate inspection protocol.

The 777-200s and 777-300s affected are older and less fuel efficient than newer models and most operators are phasing them out of their fleets.

Images posted by police in Broomfield, Colorado showed significant plane debris on the ground, including an engine cowling from the 26-year-old plane scattered outside a home.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said its initial examination of the plane indicated most of the damage was confined to the right engine, with only minor damage to the airplane.

It said the inlet and casing separated from the engine and two fan blades were fractured, while the remainder of the fan blades exhibited damage.

Japan's transport ministry ordered Japan Airlines Co Ltd (JAL) and ANA Holdings Inc to suspend the use of 777s with PW4000 engines while it considered whether to take additional measures.

The ministry said that on Dec. 4, 2020, a JAL flight from Naha Airport to Tokyo returned to Naha due to a malfunction in the left engine.

Japan Transport Safety Board said on Dec. 28 that it had found two of the left engine's fan blades were damaged, one from a fatigue fracture. The investigation is ongoing.

United is the only U.S. operator of the planes, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The other airlines using them are in Japan and South Korea, the U.S. agency said.

""We reviewed all available safety data,"" the FAA said in a statement. ""Based on the initial information, we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine, used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes.""

Japan said ANA operated 19 of the type and JAL operated 13 of them, though the airlines said their use had been reduced during the pandemic. JAL said its fleet was due for retirement by March 2022.

Pratt & Whitney, owned by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, said it was coordinating with operators and regulators to support a revised inspection interval for the engines.

An official at South Korea's transport ministry said it was waiting for formal action by the FAA before giving a directive to its airlines. The U.S. agency said it would soon issue an emergency airworthiness directive.

Korean Air Lines Co Ltd, which has 16 of the planes, 10 of them stored, said on Monday it grounded the remaining six it had in operation of its own volition.

Asiana Airlines Inc, which has nine 777s with Pratt & Whitney engines, said it is in discussion with Boeing and the relevant authorities on what measure to take.

In February 2018, a 777 of the same age operated by United and bound for Honolulu suffered an engine failure when a cowling fell off about 30 minutes before the plane landed safely. The NTSB determined that incident was the result of a full-length fan blade fracture.

Because of that 2018 incident, Pratt & Whitney reviewed inspection records for all previously inspected PW4000 fan blades, the NTSB said. The FAA in March 2019 issued a directive requiring initial and recurring inspections of the fan blades on the PW4000 engines.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/japan-requests-airlines-stop-using-boeing-777s-with-pw4000-engines-until-further-notice-2424938,0.052,0.864,0.085,0.9608

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Damage to a fan blade on an engine that failed on a United Airlines Boeing (NYSE: ) 777 flight is consistent with metal fatigue, based on a preliminary assessment, the chairman of the U.S. air accident investigator said on Monday.

The Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engine failed on Saturday with a ""loud bang"" four minutes after takeoff from Denver, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters following an initial analysis of the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder.

There was minor damage to the aircraft body but no structural damage, he said.

He said it remained unclear whether the incident is consistent with an engine failure on a different Hawaii-bound United flight in February 2018 that was attributed to a fatigue fracture in a fan blade.

""What is important that we really truly understand the facts, circumstances and conditions around this particular event before we can compare it to any other event,"" Sumwalt said.

The engine that failed on the 26-year-old Boeing Co 777 and shed parts over a Denver suburb was a PW4000 used on 128 planes, or less than 10% of the global fleet of more than 1,600 delivered 777 widebody jets.

In another incident on Japan Airlines (JAL) 777 with a PW4000 engine in December 2020, Japan's Transport Safety Board reported it found two damaged fan blades, one with a metal fatigue crack. An investigation is ongoing.

The focus is more on engine maker Pratt and analysts expect little financial impact on Boeing, but the PW4000 issues are a fresh headache for the planemaker as it recovers from the far more serious 737 MAX crisis. Boeing's flagship narrowbody jet was grounded for nearly two years after two deadly crashes.

The United engine's fan blade will be examined on Tuesday after being flown to a Pratt laboratory where it will examined under supervision of NTSB investigators.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Monday it had already been evaluating whether to adjust fan blade inspections in the wake of the December incident in Japan after reviewing maintenance records and conducting a metallurgical examination of the fan blade fragment.

Boeing recommended that airlines suspend the use of the planes while the FAA identified an appropriate inspection protocol, and Japan imposed a temporary suspension on flights.

Pratt & Whitney, owned by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp., has recommended airlines increase inspections in a plan that is being reviewed by the FAA, sources with knowledge of the matter said. Pratt did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

The FAA has said it plans to issue an emergency airworthiness directive soon that will require stepped-up inspections of the fan blades for fatigue.

""United Airlines has grounded all of the affected airplanes with these engines, and I understand the FAA is also working very quickly as well as Pratt & Whitney has reiterated or revised a service bulletin,"" Sumwalt said. ""It looks like action is being taken.""

In March 2019, after the 2018 United engine failure attributed to fan blade fatigue, the FAA ordered inspections every 6,500 cycles. A cycle is one take-off and landing.

South Korea's transport ministry said on Tuesday it had told its airlines to inspect the fan blades every 1,000 cycles following guidance from Pratt after the United incident.

Sumwalt said the United incident was not considered an uncontained engine failure because the containment ring contained the parts as they were flying out.

NTSB will look into why the engine cowling separated from the plane and also why there was a fire despite indications fuel to the engine had been turned off, Sumwalt added.

Industry sources said that although the engine is made by Pratt, the cowling, or casing, is manufactured by Boeing. Boeing referred questions on the part to the NTSB.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A United Airlines plane with a Pratt & Whitney engine that failed on Saturday had flown fewer than half the flights allowed by U.S. regulators between fan blade inspections, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.

The Boeing (NYSE: ) Co 777 plane had flown nearly 3,000 cycles, equivalent to one take-off and landing, which compares to the checks every 6,500 cycles mandated after a separate United engine incident in 2018, said the sources.

They sought anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly. United declined to comment.

Pratt, the maker of the PW4000 engines, advised airlines on Monday to step up checks to every 1,000 cycles, in a bulletin seen by Reuters. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it was ordering immediate inspections of 777 planes with PW4000 engines before they could return to flight, going further than Pratt.

The engines are used on 128 older versions of the plane, accounting for less than 10% of the more than 1,600 777s delivered and only a handful of airlines in the United States, South Korea and Japan were operating them recently.

Japan and South Korea have also grounded the planes for fan blade checks.

On Monday, the FAA acknowledged that after a Japan Airlines (JAL) PW4000 engine incident in December it had been considering stepping up blade inspections that use thermal acoustic imaging to find signs of metal fatigue.

A risk-assessment meeting was held last week to discuss the issue before the United engine failed on Saturday, one of the sources said, confirming an earlier report by CNN. No decision had been imminent ahead of the United incident, the source added.

A spokeswoman for Pratt, owned by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), said on Wednesday that fan blades would need to be shipped to its repair station in East Hartford, Connecticut, for the latest inspections, including those from Japan and South Korea.

Each engine has 22 blades that must be removed individually and each will take eight hours to inspect, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday.

That is the equivalent of 352 hours of work per plane, as each 777 has two engines. Boeing said 69 of the planes were in active service before Saturday's incident, while 59 had been grounded amid low demand during the pandemic.

Pratt did not respond to questions about how many engines it could inspect per month. United has not commented on how long it expects the inspections to take, while JAL and ANA Holdings said the timing was unclear.

(Reuters) - Japan Airlines Co Ltd (JAL) said it had retired its fleet of 13 Boeing (NYSE: ) Co 777s with Pratt & Whitney engines a year earlier than planned, having suspended operations in February after an engine on a United Airlines plane shed debris.

""JAL has decided to accelerate the retirement of all P&W equipped Boeing 777 by March 2021, which (was) originally planned by March 2022,"" the Japanese airline said on Monday in a notice on its website.

JAL said it would use newer Airbus SE (OTC: ) A350s on domestic routes to Osaka's Itami Airport and use international planes for other domestic routes to help maintain flight frequencies.

Flying demand industry-wide is currently lower than usual due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Japanese carrier had an incident of its own with the PW4000 engines in December, when a malfunction forced a Tokyo-bound JAL 777 to return to Naha airport.

The engines are found on only a small number of older 777s operated by JAL, United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: ) Inc, ANA Holdings Inc, Korean Air Lines Co Ltd, Asiana Airlines Inc and Jin Air Co Ltd.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in February had ordered immediate inspection of 777 planes with PW4000 engines before further flights after the National Transportation Safety Board found a cracked fan blade on the United flight was consistent with metal fatigue.

A spokeswoman for Pratt, owned by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, in February said fan blades would need to be shipped to its repair station in East Hartford, Connecticut, for inspection, including those from airlines in Japan and South Korea.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has told Congress it is proceeding with more than $23 billion in weapons sales to the United Arab Emirates, including advanced F-35 aircraft, armed drones and other equipment, congressional aides said on Tuesday.

A State Department spokesperson said the administration would move forward with the proposed sales to the UAE, ""even as we continue reviewing details and consulting with Emirati officials"" related to the use of the weapons.

The Democratic president's administration had paused the deals agreed to by former Republican President Donald Trump in order to review them. The sales to the Gulf nation were finalized right before Trump left office.

The Trump administration told Congress in November it had approved the U.S. sale to the UAE as a side deal to the Abraham Accords, a U.S.-brokered agreement in September in which the UAE agreed to normalize relations with Israel.

In the last months of the Trump administration, Israel reached deals with the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco as part of the accords.

The $23.37 billion package contained products from General Atomics, Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, including 50 F-35 Lighting II aircraft, up to 18 MQ-9B Unmanned Aerial Systems and a package of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions.

YEMEN CONFLICT

Some U.S. lawmakers have criticized the UAE for its involvement in the war in Yemen, a conflict considered one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters, and worried that the weapons transfers might violate U.S. guarantees that Israel will retain a military advantage in the region.

Israel said it did not object to the sales.

A legislative effort to stop the sales failed in December, as Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress backed his plans.

The Trump administration then finalized the massive sale to the UAE on Jan. 20, about an hour before Biden was sworn in as president.

The Biden administration announced the review in late January and the UAE said then it had anticipated the review and welcomed joint efforts to de-escalate tensions and for renewed regional dialogue.

The State Department spokesperson said on Tuesday the estimated delivery dates on the UAE sales, if implemented, were for after 2025 or later.

The government anticipated ""a robust and sustained dialogue with the UAE"" to ensure a stronger security partnership, the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

""We will also continue to reinforce with the UAE and all recipients of U.S. defense articles and services that U.S.-origin defense equipment must be adequately secured and used in a manner that respects human rights and fully complies with the laws of armed conflict,"" the statement said.

The Biden administration is also reviewing its policy for military sales to Saudi Arabia, including some Trump-era weapons deals, in light of the Saudi involvement in Yemen and other human rights concerns.

It has not released the results of that review. In February, U.S. officials told Reuters the administration was considering cancelling past deals that posed human rights concerns and limiting future sales to ""defensive"" weapons.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/biden-administration-proceeding-with-23-billion-weapon-sales-to-uae-2473670,0.084,0.848,0.068,-0.9375

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two senior Democratic senators will introduce legislation on Friday that would reassert Congress' oversight of international weapons deals, after President Joe Biden's administration decided to go ahead with a $23 billion sale to the United Arab Emirates that had worried lawmakers, congressional aides said.

The bill, seen by Reuters, will be introduced by Senators Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Dianne Feinstein, a senior member of the intelligence committee.

The ""Secure F-35 Exports Act of 2020"" would apply to the sale of the sophisticated U.S. military technology to countries that are not NATO members or Israel, Australia, Japan, South Korea or New Zealand.

Among other things, it would bar the sale of the F-35s - which can take years after a deal is agreed - unless any president makes detailed certifications to Congress that the critical technology would not fall into the wrong hands, or otherwise compromise advanced technology.

It also would require that any sale to a Middle Eastern country other than Israel not compromise Israel's military advantage over such countries, and come with assurances that the aircraft would not be used in operations harmful to Israel's security.

Reuters reported on Tuesday that the Biden administration had told lawmakers it was proceeding with more than $23 billion in weapons sales to the United Arab Emirates, including advanced F-35 aircraft, armed drones and other equipment.

The Democrat's administration had paused the deals agreed to by former Republican President Donald Trump to allow a review.

The sales to the Gulf nation were signed right before Trump left office on Jan. 20, and many members of Congress - especially Biden's fellow Democrats - felt they had been rushed through without proper review.

""We must enact protections to ensure the incredibly sensitive technology of these aircraft is not compromised by powers hostile to the United States, including making sure the UAE pulls back from its burgeoning relationship with China and other U.S. competitors,"" Menendez said in a statement provided to Reuters.

The Trump administration told Congress in November it had approved the U.S. sale to the UAE as a side deal to the Abraham Accords, a U.S.-brokered agreement in September in which the UAE agreed to normalize relations with Israel.

In the last months of the Trump administration, Israel reached deals with the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco as part of the accords.

The $23.37 billion package contained products from General Atomics, Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, including 50 F-35 Lighting II aircraft, up to 18 MQ-9B Unmanned Aerial Systems and a package of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions.

Lawmakers in the House of Representatives have also said they are worried by Biden's decision. Representative Gregory Meeks, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Wednesday he and other lawmakers were concerned about the decision and would review the transactions.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Max Polyakov, an ultra-wealthy entrepreneur with ambitions of building a space transportation empire, has acquired South African satellite maker Dragonfly Aerospace, he told Reuters.

The deal gives Polyakov an anchorpoint in the booming but fiercely competitive market for small-satellite technology, and a potential revenue source for rocket maker Firefly Aerospace, which is majority-owned by Polyakov's Noosphere Ventures investment fund.

He declined to disclose the value of the deal, which closed earlier this month. It has not been previously reported. An announcement is expected on Tuesday.

""This deal gives us cost-control and mass production of components,"" Polyakov told Reuters by phone. ""It allows us to bring everything in-house.""

The acquisition comes amid a frenzy of capital infusions and blank-check deal-making around a new breed of firms building miniaturized launch systems to cash in on the exponential growth of compact satellites needing a ride to orbit in the coming years.

Texas-based Firefly is seeking to raise up to $350 million in multiple tranches over 12 months as part of a plan to expand production and bring to market its higher-capacity Beta rocket, two people familiar with the matter said.

One of them told Reuters an announcement on an initial infusion could be made in the coming days.

A Firefly spokesman declined to comment.

Polyakov hopes Dragonfly's satellites could launch on Firefly's Alpha rocket, which Polyakov said could potentially debut before the end of June.

Firefly, U.S.-New Zealand startup Rocket Lab and billionaire British entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit are front-runners in a long list of small-launch providers seeking to cash in on the small satellite trend.

The boom is fueled in part by venture cash and technology leaps that have reduced the size and boosted the capabilities of satellites used for everything from communications to national security to climate studies.

The sprawling field of small-satellite makers includes SpaceX's Starlink, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: )'s Kuiper, Britain's OneWeb, venture-backed Planet, and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp's Blue Canyon Technologies.

Among them, Polyakov's Dragonfly aims to build up to 48 satellites per year for commercial and civil space customers. For example, Dragonfly develops satellite cameras for Earth Observing Systems Data Analytics, which is owned by Polyakov's Menlo Park, California-based Noosphere Ventures.

Polyakov plans to expand Dragonfly Aerospace's presence with new facilities in the U.S. and Europe, he said, without providing a specific time frame.",https://www.investing.com/news/general/exclusive-space-entrepreneur-max-polyakov-acquires-south-africas-dragonfly-satellite-maker-2485609,0.007,0.932,0.061,0.967

(Reuters) -U.S. aerospace manufacturer Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp on Tuesday lifted the lower end of its full-year sales forecast on strong performance of its defense unit and a recovery in commercial air travel.

Neil Mitchill, Raytheon (NYSE: )'s newly appointed chief financial officer, said in an interview that ""increasing confidence and a commercial aero recovery that we began to see take hold at the end of the first quarter"" led to the company's view for 2021.

While demand for Raytheon's aviation technologies and service for aircraft manufacturers slumped during the global health crisis, its robust defense unit that contributes more than half of overall sales continued to lift its bottomline.

During the quarter, the company had a notable $1.4 billion in classified bookings for work at Raytheon's Intelligence and Space unit, which Mitchill said was ""clearly an indication that the operations tempo is increasing from where we saw it exiting 2020.""

The company now expects between $63.9 billion and $65.4 billion in full-year sales, compared with its previous forecast of $63.4 billion to $65.4 billion.

For the quarter, Raytheon had earnings per share of $0.90 versus Wall Street analyst's consensus estimate of $0.88. Revenue rose to $15.25 billion from $11.36 billion but missed Wall Street's estimate of $15.36 billion.

Net income attributable to common shareowners was $753 million, or 50 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from a loss of $83 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier.

Raytheon increased its 2021 share repurchase authorization from $1.5 billion to at least $2 billion.

The company, which had about 195,000 employees when it merged with United Technologies last April, has laid off nearly 20,000 full-time and contract employees in its commercial aerospace business, which makes aircraft engines and spare parts. Raytheon said savings from the merger increased by $300 million to $1.3 billion.

On a call with Wall Street analysts, management said Raytheon was cooperating with Department of Justice investigations into contract pricing in the 2011-2013 timeframe. Management said the investigations were not expected to have a material impact.

Raytheon ended the first quarter with a backlog of $147.4 billion.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/raytheon-raises-fullyear-sales-forecast-2486290,0.026,0.889,0.085,0.9676

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ninety minutes before President Joe Biden took office on January 20th, the United States signed a $23 billion dollar deal to sell F-35 jets, drones and advanced missiles to the United Arab Emirates.

It was part of flurry of last minute deals President Donald Trump had told Congress were coming in his last two months in office, forcing the Biden administration to make quick decisions on whether or not to stick with the geopolitically sensitive weapons sales.

To the surprise of some Democratic allies, Biden has so far kept the lion's share of Trump's more controversial agreements. Executives at five large defense contractors who requested anonymity to speak freely were also surprised by the speed of the Biden administration's deliberations.

Longer-term, however, those executives and five more people in and around the administration told Reuters that Biden's policy will shift to emphasize human rights over Trump's more commercial approach to exporting military equipment.

Biden's posture towards arms exports - specifically around reducing weapons used to attack others - could shift sales at Boeing (NYSE: ) Co, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp and Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ). That means fewer bullets, bombs and missiles, while security products like radars, surveillance equipment and defenses against attacks get the green light.

In an interview last week, Raytheon (NYSE: )'s CFO Neil Mitchill said that offensive munitions exports, ""going forward, the kinds of sales that we were talking about have been declining,"" adding there has been a multi-year downward trend of offensive weapon sales to foreign customers.

Boeing and Lockheed declined to comment.

In the early days of the Biden administration, officials paused weapons sales to Middle East allies, including sales of Raytheon's and Boeing-made precision guided munitions to Saudi Arabia.

Eventually a determination was made to only sell the Kingdom ""defensive"" arms, while limiting weapons that could be used to attack out of concern over casualties in Saudi Arabia's war with Yemen.

Biden's team ultimately decided to stick with the massive UAE deal. The move spurred criticism from the human rights group Amnesty International which immediately bashed the decision and drew complaints from lawmaker Robert Menendez, Chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

One former U.S. official familiar with the Biden transition team's thinking noted that many aspects of the F-35 sale still need to be negotiated, giving them leverage as the Abraham Accords between UAE and Israel are implemented. The F-35 sale was a side deal to the accords.

PIVOT TO DEFENSE

But arms deals like Trump's UAE agreement, and others with governments that have poor records on human rights records look far less likely from the Biden White House.

""While economic security will remain a factor"" when reviewing weapons sales, the Biden Administration will ""reprioritize"" other factors including U.S. national security, human rights and nonproliferation, a U.S. official has told Reuters.

""I'm hopeful that as we hear statements that support human rights as being front and center in arms transfer deliberations, we'll see that play out through actual decisions, and not just words,"" Rachel Stohl, vice president at the Stimson Center in Washington said.

During the transition period from election day in November to Biden's inauguration, Trump's team sent notification of $31 billion of foreign arms sales to Congress. Congressional notifications occur for most foreign military sales before a contract can be signed to sell a weapon.

On average, foreign military sales under Trump amounted to $57.5 billion per year, versus an average of $53.9 billion per year for the eight years under his predecessor Barack Obama, in 2020 dollars, according to Bill Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Program at the Center for International Policy think tank.

Biden's approval of several late-Trump deals will ease the political and diplomatic transition from one administration to another, according to a State Department official. In the case of the UAE deal, the official said, it helps the two nations ""meet our mutual strategic objectives to build a stronger, interoperable, and more capable security partnership.""

As Lockheed's CEO Jim Taiclet put it to Reuters late last year, ""alliances are really important... Foreign Military Sales are part and parcel of that.""

The Biden administration inherited a backlog of more than 500 weapons export deals teed up by the Trump administration, one person briefed on the State Department's backlog said.

Going forward, the Stimson Center's Rachel Stohl said Biden's State Department team is ""looking at countries, at individual weapons systems, as well as individual sales."" But as more appointees take their posts at the State Department she said there could be a ""paradigm shift on the way in which arms sales are considered as part of holistic efforts to develop and build partnerships and capacity.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysisbiden-poised-to-pivot-us-arms-deals-toward-security-human-rights-2495736,0.05,0.864,0.086,0.9829

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Twenty U.S. senators from both parties wrote a letter to the heads of the Appropriations and Armed Services committees supporting Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: )'s F-35 jet, which has suffered from cost overruns and delays.

In the May 5 letter, seen by Reuters, the senators urged funding of modernization and sustainment plans for the jet, which has struggled to meet targeted cost-per-flying-hour goals as well as mission capability rates.

The letter comes ahead of the release of the detailed version of the Pentagon's 2022 budget request in the coming weeks and follows a similar letter signed by 132 members of the U.S. House of Representatives from April 28.

Pentagon officials, executives from Lockheed, the jet's prime contractor, and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp's Pratt and Whitney division, which makes the F-35 engine, testified before the House Armed Services Committee on April 20 about the jet's strengths and weaknesses.

During the testimony the executives said they were working to rectify deficiencies in the program that ran the gambit from slow software updates for the jet and its systems, to early deterioration of parts like fan blades and the pilot's canopy.

Lockheed plans to deliver between 133 and 139 of the jets this year.

The senators noted, ""near-peer adversaries like China and Russia continue to advance their air defense systems, develop their own 5th generation fighters, and invest heavily in emerging technologies that threaten America's military edge.""

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has appointed a senior internal supply chain executive to run its Canadian operation, with responsibility for trimming losses on the A220 jetliner series, in the latest in a series of management changes at the European aerospace group.

Benoit Schultz, 48, will take over on Sept. 1 from Philippe Balducchi, a former finance executive who became the first head of the Canadian venture when Airbus bought the CSeries jet programme from Bombardier (OTC: ) in 2018 and renamed it A220.

Schultz, who was part of the team that ran a ruler over Bombardier's supplier relationships when Airbus rescued it from cash shortages, is currently a senior vice president in the Airbus procurement office, which runs its global supply chain.

He steps up as Balducchi plans to ""pursue opportunities"" outside the group after integrating the former Bombardier plants into Airbus and opening a new U.S. assembly line, Airbus said. The Canadian-designed A220, with 110-130 seats and a modern lightweight design, has seen a boost in sales under Airbus after its development took a heavy financial toll that triggered Bombardier's near-total exit from the aerospace market.

It has notched up more net orders so far this year than any other Airbus model as airlines seek to reduce fuel costs and favour smaller aircraft in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. But while sales have benefited from the stronger Airbus marketing machine, industry sources say the European group has yet to secure low enough prices for many of the plane's components to push the A220 project convincingly into the black.

That creates a growing dilemma for Airbus as although new sales are good for the order book, producing those extra planes at costs that remain too high could simply deepen the losses. Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury has been seeking cuts of 20% in the cost of major components, industry sources say. One source said Airbus had obtained solid cuts from dominant suppliers Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) - which makes engines and avionics - and wingmaker Spirit Aero Systems but was still struggling to make a significant dent in most other costs.

Airbus could further reduce costs by redesigning parts and overhauling the production system for the A220, which competes with Embraer regional jets and smaller Boeing (NYSE: ) 737s, but such spending is seen unlikely during the pandemic.

Airbus had no immediate comment on cost-cutting efforts.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/airbus-puts-supply-chain-executive-at-helm-of-lossmaking-a220-2501134,0.055,0.876,0.068,0.6187

(Reuters) - Billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb's Third Point (NYSE: ) owns a substantial stake in Vivendi (OTC: ) SE and is ""evaluating"" the French media giant's plan to sell a stake in its Universal Music Group to rival billionaire investor William Ackman, a source familiar with the firm's holdings said on Monday.

New York-based Third Point has been invested in Paris-based Vivendi for some time, the person said, requesting anonymity because the matter is private.

A Vivendi spokesman on Monday said, ""The company has yet to see any evidence of a stake being built,"" in response to a question about the Third Point holding. A Third Point representative declined to comment.

Third Point's stake was first reported by Bloomberg.

Vivendi has become popular with certain investors ever since it announced plans to spin off 60% of Universal. Earlier this month Ackman said his blank-check company Pershing Square Tontine Holdings is planning to buy 10% of Universal before the planned spinoff.

Vivendi, controlled by French tycoon Vincent Bollore, last month set out a plan to list Universal, the world's largest music group, by Sept. 27.

Investors will have a chance to vote on the proposed spinoff later this month and some have already expressed reservations.

Activist fund Bluebell Capital Partners and investment fund Artisan Partners (NYSE: ) have raised concerns about the spinoff, decrying the transaction as unfavorable to some investors.

Glass Lewis and ISS, the world's two biggest proxy advisers,

have recommended Vivendi shareholders vote in favor of the

spinoff plans.

Third Point is trying to evaluate what Ackman's proposal would mean for Vivendi shareholders and has not commented publicly about the matter.

Loeb and Ackman, both prominent New York hedge fund managers, have crossed on other investments, including Herbalife (NYSE: ) and United Technologies (NYSE: ), for example, and sometimes taken differing approaches.

Loeb has had his own blank check company and invested in a number of others, according to letters to his investors and regulatory filings. He did not invest with Pershing Square's Tontine Holdings, which counts other prominent hedge funds as investors.

PARIS (Reuters) -General Electric and France's Safran (PA: ) has unveiled plans to test-build an open-bladed jet engine able to reduce fuel use and emissions by 20% as they prolonged their historic CFM International joint venture by a decade to 2050.

The ""RISE"" engine, positioned as a possible successor to the ""LEAP"" model used on the Boeing (NYSE: ) 737 MAX and some Airbus A320neo, will feature a design with visible fan blades known as open-rotor and could enter service by the mid-2030s.

The system will contain hybrid-electric propulsion and be capable of running on 100% sustainable fuel or hydrogen, an energy source favoured by Airbus for future concepts.

CFM is the world's largest jet engine maker by the number of units sold. It is the sole engine supplier for the Boeing 737 MAX and competes with Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) unit Pratt & Whitney for airline engine selections on the Airbus A320neo.

The technology demonstrator project comes as the industry prepares to battle over the next generation of single-aisle planes like the MAX and A320neo in the busiest part of the airplane market while facing mounting environmental pressure.

Industry sources have said Boeing is considering launching a replacement for its slightly larger and long-range single-aisle 757 that could pave the way for a replacement of the MAX.

But it has deferred a decision on whether to move relatively quickly - a step that would require an available conventional engine - or wait for the arrival of technology like open-rotor with hybrid propulsion, Reuters reported recently.

GE Aviation Chief Executive John Slattery said CFM would be ready to compete for whatever jet might be launched and challenged other engine makers to compete with the technology.

""If Boeing or any airframer launches a platform and the business case makes sense for us, then we will present our best aggregate technologies that we have at that moment in time,"" he told a news conference on Monday.

Boeing said it regularly conducted technology studies and collaborated with suppliers. It gave no fresh indication whether open-rotor technology could power its next jetliner.

Airbus, which says it is working on a zero-emission plane to enter service in 2035, said on Tuesday it welcomed the fact that the engine was expected to be ""agnostic"" about the type of fuel.

""We await news of where Airbus and Boeing are headed,"" Jefferies (NYSE: ) analyst Sandy Morris said.

Safran shares rose 1.6% early on Tuesday, buoyed also by signs of a truce in an aircraft trade war.

SUMMIT BIRTH

The open-rotor engine concept places previously hidden whirring parts on the outside of the engine to capture more air and reduce the burden on the engine's fuel-burning core.

Previous attempts since the 1980s to develop such engines have had to contend with concerns including noise.

Safran Chief Executive Olivier Andries said a prototype tested in 2017 had produced no more noise than the LEAP.

""I am very confident we will meet the most stringent noise regulations ... and safety requirements,"" he told Reuters.

All eyes are now on rivals led by Pratt & Whitney, which is expected to give updates on its geared turbofan later this year.

""We are committed to continued investment in evolving propulsion systems to power the next generation of commercial aircraft,"" Pratt & Whitney said.

Founded in 1974, CFM saw the light of day after a summit deal between U.S. President Richard Nixon and French counterpart Georges Pompidou, following attempts by the Pentagon to block it on the grounds that its engine was related to the B-1 bomber.

Under a compromise, French engineers were banned at first from looking inside the sealed casing of the original CFM core.

Although such restrictions vanished long ago, GE and Safran still maintain an unusual Chinese Wall between them over costs on the world’s most-sold jet engines to avoid disputes.

""One of the ingredients of CFM's success is that we share the revenues; we don't share the costs. If one of us is not competitive, it doesn't reflect on the (other) partner. Everyone is fully responsible,"" Andries said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ge-safran-to-develop-new-jet-engine-under-extended-jv-2531475,0.044,0.875,0.08,0.9733

By Paulina Duran

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Starlink, the satellite internet unit of Elon Musk's SpaceX, expects to be able to provide continuous global coverage by around September but will then need to seek regulatory approvals, its president Gwynne Shotwell said on Tuesday.

""We've successfully deployed 1,800 or so satellites and once all those satellites reach their operational orbit, we will have continuous global coverage, so that should be like September timeframe,"" she told a Macquarie Group (OTC: ) technology conference via webcast.

""But then we have regulatory work to go into every country and get approved to provide telecoms services.""

Starlink, which has said it plans to deploy 12,000 satellites in total at a cost of roughly $10 billion, currently offers beta services in 11 countries, Shotwell said.

In May, Musk said the low-Earth orbiting satellite network had received more than 500,000 preorders for its internet service and anticipates no technical problems meeting demand.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission this year approved SpaceX's plan to deploy some Starlink satellites at a lower earth orbit than planned to provide high-speed broadband internet services to people who currently lack access.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of F-16 fighter jets, as well as Sidewinder and Harpoon missiles, to the Philippines in three separate deals with a combined value of more than $2.5 billion, the Pentagon said on Thursday.

The Philippines is looking for a new multi-role fighter jet and is evaluating the F-16 and the SAAB Abs Gripen.

The announcement comes as the United States seeks to renew an agreement with the Philippines governing the U.S. troop presence in the country, which is critical to Washington’s strategy to counter ever-expanding Chinese activity in Asia.

Last week, the Philippines again suspended for another six months a move to scrap the two-decade-old Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) that had been due to expire in August.

The Pentagon said the Philippines requested to buy 10 F-16C Block 70/72 aircraft and two F-16D Block 70/72 aircraft made by Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) Co. That package, which includes spares and training, is valued at up to $2.43 billion.

Despite the State Department approval, the notification does not indicate that a contract has been signed or that negotiations have concluded. Often during a competition, the department will approve exports before a winner is named.

Eric Sayers, a visiting fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said it appeared to be ""a proactive effort by Washington to ensure the United States remains the security partner of choice for Manila.""

Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who has frequently condemned U.S. foreign policy while exploring closer ties with China, told Washington last year he was canceling the VFA amid outrage over a senator and ally being denied a U.S. visa. But he has repeatedly suspended the expiration date.

Gregory Poling, maritime security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said one of Duterte’s complaints has been his perception that the United States does not provide high-quality equipment to the Philippines.

""I’d expect that the U.S. government will be looking for opportunities over the next six months to combat that perception,"" he said.

The Pentagon also notified Congress on Thursday of the possible sale of two missile packages to the Philippines.

One was for 12 Harpoon Air Launched Block II Missiles, two training missiles, spares and equipment made by Boeing (NYSE: ) and valued at up to $120 million.

Another was for 24 AIM-9X Sidewinder Block II tactical missiles, 24 training missiles and spare parts made by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) and valued at up to $42.4 million.

The Philippines is a U.S. treaty ally and several military agreements are dependent on the VFA, which governs the rotation of thousands of U.S. troops in and out of the Philippines.

Having the ability to rotate in troops is important not only for the defense of the Philippines, but strategically for the United States when it comes to countering China's increasingly assertive behavior in the region.

""The package is a serious step that will certainly get Beijing's attention,"" said Sayers.

Lockheed Martin said the F-16 would play a significant role in strengthening Manila's strategic partnership with Washington and allies, while enabling the Philippines to join other Southeast Asian F-16 operators.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/us-state-dept-oks-possible-sale-of-f16s-missiles-to-philippines-2542012,0.052,0.824,0.123,0.9887

(Reuters) -Raytheon Technologies Corp has been awarded an about $2 billion contract by the U.S. Air Force to develop and make a nuclear-armed cruise missile, the U.S. aerospace maker said on Thursday.

The long-range standoff weapon (LRSO) will be manufactured in Tucson, Arizona, and is expected to be completed in February 2027, Raytheon (NYSE: ) said.

It will replace the aging air-launched cruise missile that was fielded in the early 1980s with a 10-year design life.

Bloomberg News earlier on Thursday reported that the Air Force plans to buy up to 1,000 LRSOs. (https://bloom.bg/3dA4CJQ)",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/raytheon-gets-2-billion-us-air-force-contract-for-longrange-weapon-2548247,0.016,0.965,0.019,0.128

The global IPO market hit record highs in the first half of 2021. This trend is likely to continue given the favorable market environment. For investors looking to invest in newly listed companies with lower risk profiles, we think the shares of the two companies spun off by United Technologies—Carrier Global (NYSE: ) and Otis (OTIS)—could be solid choices. Let’s discuss.The bullish equity markets and favorable investor sentiment have incentivized several private companies to go public over the past couple of months. The low-cost alternatives to traditional IPOs, such as direct listings and SPACs, have also boosted stock market debuts over the past year. As of June 15, initial public offerings in the United States raised $171 billion, surpassing 2020’s $168 billion.

The average one-day return for U.S. IPOs through June 30, 2021 was 40.5% versus 28.2% during the same period in 2020. Global IPO proceeds reached 20-year highs in the first quarter of 2021. Global IPO volumes have increased 85% year-over-year, with proceeds increasing 271% year-over-year.

However, investors should consider a company’s financials and growth prospects before investing in its freshly traded shares. With this in mind, we think fundamentally sound companies Carrier Global Corporation (CARR) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (NYSE: ), which were spun off from renowned United Technologies Corporation (NYSE: ), could be good additions to one's portfolio.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has asked the Federal Trade Commission to take a tougher look at defense industry mergers, questioning a proposal from Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) that would allow it to buy the biggest independent maker of rocket motors, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE: ).

The Democratic senator, who has a keen interest in corporate behavior, asked the FTC to examine the premise and efficacy of internal firewalls like those Lockheed proposes to prevent it from gaining a competitive advantage over peers once the deal closes, according to a July 16 letter seen by Reuters.

Lockheed Martin announced a $4.4 billion agreement to buy Aerojet late last year, a deal that has raised eyebrows because it would give Lockheed - the No. 1 defense contractor - ownership of a vital piece of the U.S. missile industry whose motors are used in everything from the homeland missile shield to Stinger missiles.

Lockheed has said after the deal closes ""the Aerojet Rocketdyne business will continue to serve as a merchant supplier"" to the entire defense industry, a premise that was met with skepticism by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), a major customer for rocket motors.

Internal firewalls would be needed at the new company to protect competitor intellectual property, pricing and product progress in the highly competitive weapons business.

Warren's letter urged the FTC to take a stronger antitrust stance on defense deals and said the Lockheed tie-up should not be allowed until the FTC understood the effectiveness of past internal firewalls, which she views as necessary to maintain competition, as well as national security.

In a statement, Lockheed said the company ""has a long history of successfully and ethically operating as a merchant supplier to the entire industry,"" adding it has operated with ""effective and trusted firewalls"" in the past.

A firewall is an example of a ""behavioral remedy,"" one of the tools the FTC has to preserve competition. That is why Warren's letter to FTC Chair Lina Khan asked if ""behavioral remedies"" have protected competition and prevented monopolistic behavior in the defense industry.

Behavioral remedies usually expire after a few years.

A ""structural remedy,"" a more common enforcement mechanism, generally requires a company to sell a line of business to prevent monopolistic behavior.

In February, the FTC extended its review of the deal under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act to scrutinize potentially anti-competitive mergers.

Lockheed said it expected the deal to close in the fourth quarter of this year.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/senator-warren-questions-lockheeds-antitrust-solution-to-buy-aerojet-2562736,0.018,0.846,0.136,0.9922

(Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration is proposing sweeping changes to its government purchasing rule to increase the content of American-made goods, senior administration officials said.

The new rule is designed in a way that gives contractors time to shift their supply chains but is stringent enough to have an immediate impact on the way taxpayer dollars are used, one official said. President Joe Biden began the process in an executive order he signed in January, shortly after taking office, and the White House has received input from businesses and unions, the officials added.

Biden on Wednesday is set to visit the Mack-Lehigh Valley Operations Manufacturing Facility in Lower Macungie Township in Pennsylvania. He’s scheduled to give remarks in the afternoon on the importance of U.S. manufacturing and buying products made in the country. The plant assembles Mack Trucks.

Under the rule, the domestic content threshold would be raised immediately to 60% -- a 5% increase from existing standards -- and increase in phases to 75% by 2029.

The White House says the immediate change would close a loophole and eventually create more opportunities for small- and medium-sized companies. The proposal would also apply enhanced price preferences to certain critical products to support domestic supply chains for these goods.

The proposal still has to go through a 60-day comment period and only takes effect after a final rule is published. The White House signed off on the proposal in early July but declined to release it until now. Officials said this is just the first set of reforms to existing rules aimed at bolstering American manufacturing and innovation.

Since his campaign last year, Biden promised to ensure that the federal government spends money on buying “made in America” products and in his first cabinet meeting, he instructed each agency to focus their efforts on spending taxpayer dollars in a way that supports U.S. manufacturing.

Under his administration, government agencies have spent more than $2 billion on products produced in the U.S. They include electric vehicles for the Department of Energy’s fleet and the Department of Labor buying $1.5 million of products, from office furniture to safety testing equipment for mines and other workplaces, according to a White House fact sheet.

The president’s proposal comes as federal spending on contracts is increasing, in part because federal agencies are awash in stimulus money to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Federal spending on contracts reached a record high of $682 billion in fiscal year 2020, up 14% from the previous year, according to Bloomberg Government’s federal contracting data. Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: )., Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp. and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE: ). received a combined $129.5 billion of that spending.

It’s also likely to increase again this fiscal year, which ends in September, because the recent $1.9 trillion stimulus package offers health officials tens of billions of dollars in supplemental funding to continue fighting the coronavirus, including for testing and contact tracing.

The president will have to balance this proposal with promises to reshape federal buying to combat climate change and bolster unions. Earlier this year, he ordered the federal government to buy electric vehicles made in America with union labor, combining all three priorities. There’s just one problem: No such vehicles exist.

The proposal also doesn’t address professional services. Agencies spent roughly $90.3 billion in that area in fiscal 2020, a $6.2 billion increase from the prior year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is preparing an overhaul of arms export policy to increase the emphasis on human rights, a departure from former President Donald Trump's prioritization of economic benefits to U.S. defense contractors, four people familiar with the initiative said.

Defense companies and activists scrutinize such policies for insight into the administration's posture as it balances the commercial interests of exporters like Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) Co and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) against the country's stated commitment to human rights.

Two State Department deputy assistant secretaries will brief congressional staff on Biden's draft Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) Policy on Friday, said two of the people familiar with the situation, with a formal unveiling expected as soon as September.

The administration briefed a smaller group of congressional aides about two weeks ago, outlining a State Department desire for a ""more robust"" review of weapons sales with more input from the department's human rights bureau, an administration source and a congressional aide who participated said.

Details of the proposed shift have yet to be finalized and are being circulated to other, more export-friendly agencies like the Department of Defense, the people said. The Pentagon has traditionally advocated for putting weapons in the hands of allies so U.S. forces can rely on them more heavily in overseas conflicts.

One congressional aide involved in briefings on the matter said he expected any policy change would have the most impact on sales of smaller weapons such as assault rifles and surveillance equipment, which can be used by police or paramilitary forces against domestic populations.

A senior administration official confirmed that the new CAT policy was being worked on and ""will help us build and maintain strategic partnerships that best reflect the values and interests of the United States.""

The new policy would also ""more robustly discuss"" connections between arms transfers and human rights, the official said.

The revamped policy could affect sales to countries like the Philippines, where human rights groups have called for investigation of police use of lethal force during raids.

Sales of major systems, such as air defense systems or naval systems, could be slowed although they likely would still go ahead.

""In some cases it will add an extra layer to getting to yes on a particular case,"" the congressional aide said.

PROGRESSIVE PRESSURE

Advocates of a stronger emphasis on human rights said the shift could affect sales to countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, especially given pressure from the progressive wing of Biden's Democratic Party over the toll on civilians of their raids in the civil war in Yemen.

""A new U.S. approach to arms sales is sorely needed. We must move beyond approaching arms sales as purely a transaction,"" said Rachel Stohl, vice president at the Stimson Center in Washington.

""Overall, the Biden people seem to be in the same mode as the Trump people in promoting arms exports,"" the congressional aide said, noting that the tempo of weapons sales under the Biden administration is about the same as under Trump.

The United States is easily the world's biggest arms merchant, selling over $100 billion in weapons, services and training a year.

Trump, a Republican who favored weapons sales as a way to create U.S. jobs, rolled out in 2018 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-arms/trump-launches-effort-to-boost-u-s-weapons-sales-abroad-idUSKBN1HQ2E6 a new version of the CAT policy that gave commercial concerns as much weight as human rights in deciding whether to approve weapons sales.

U.S. weapons manufacturers backed Trump's strategy, which called for Cabinet secretaries to act as closers on major arms deals and sent top government officials to promote U.S. weapons at international air shows and arms bazaars.

Trump himself promoted arms deals in meetings and conversations with foreign leaders, including pressing the emir of Kuwait to move forward with a $10 billion fighter jet deal.

He controversially cast aside congressional review of major arms deals to push through a massive sale of smart bombs and other weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, despite concerns about the Yemen war and murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Trump said Riyadh was spending billions ""on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing (NYSE: ), Lockheed Martin, Raytheon (NYSE: ) and many other great U.S. defense contractors"" and canceling the contracts would be ""foolish.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-biden-plans-shift-in-arms-export-policy-to-favor-human-rights--sources-2579696,0.066,0.83,0.105,0.9617

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, responding to a letter from progressive Senator Elizabeth Warren, wrote in a letter released Thursday that she believed antitrust enforcers should take steps to block more deals.

The FTC and Justice Department, which share the work of antitrust enforcement, will often have merging companies sell assets or agree to certain practices in order to address competition concerns so that planned deals may to go forward. The FTC, to which Khan was recently appointed as chair, tends to review defense industry deals.

Responding to a letter from Warren about concerns over defense mergers, Khan said studies have shown that divestitures often fell short. ""In light of this, I believe the antitrust agencies should more frequently consider opposing problematic deals outright,"" she said in the letter dated August 6.

She was similarly skeptical of behavioral remedies, saying ""behavioral remedies pose significant administrability problems and have often failed to prevent the merged entity from engaging in anticompetitive tactics.""

Warren had previously asked the FTC to take a tougher look at defense industry mergers, questioning a proposal from Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) that would allow it to buy Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE: ), the biggest independent maker of rocket motors.

Shares of Aerojet fell more than 4% in afternoon trading once Khan's letter was made public.

Warren had asked the FTC in particular to examine the efficacy of firewalls like those Lockheed proposes to prevent it from gaining a competitive advantage over peers once the deal closes, according to a July 16 letter whose contents were first published by Reuters.

The $4.4 billion deal has raised eyebrows because Lockheed would take over a company that produces 70% of the solid fuel rocket motors and other propulsion products used in everything from antiballistic missiles to air-to-air missiles.

The chief executive of one of Aerojet's biggest customers, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, said his company would speak with antitrust regulators because of their ""concerns"" about the deal.

A Lockheed spokesperson said the company expects the deal to close in the fourth quarter.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-ftc-chair-calls-for-tougher-stance-on-defense-mergers-2588852,0.036,0.871,0.092,0.9287

Rising geopolitical tensions and bipartisan support for a big increase in the fiscal 2022 U.S. defense budget should benefit prominent aerospace and defense players Raytheon (NYSE: ) (RTX) and General Dynamics (GD). But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out.Waltham, Mass.-based Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE: ) and General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE: ) in Falls Church, Va., are two well-established companies in the U.S. aerospace and defense industry. RTX provides advanced systems and services for commercial, military, and government customers worldwide. It operates through four segments—Collins Aerospace Systems; Pratt & Whitney; Raytheon Intelligence & Space; and Raytheon Missiles & Defense. GD offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation, combat vehicles, weapons systems, munitions, shipbuilding design and construction, information systems, and technologies.

Rising geopolitical tensions related to the collapse of the government in Afghanistan might work favorably for the aerospace and defense industry. In addition, because Pentagon leaders are requesting additional funding in the fiscal 2022 defense budget, the industry could benefit. The U.S. aerospace and defense market is projected to grow at a 2.4% CAGR to $550.78 billion by 2030. So, both RTX and GD should benefit.

While RTX has delivered 19.9% returns year-to-date, GD has surged 33.9% in price. In terms of their past month’s performance, GD is a clear winner with 3.9% gains versus RTX’s negative returns. But, which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

(Reuters) - Aerospace companies are urging the United States to speed up a review of rule changes for airplane engines, warning delays in implementing planned global emissions standards could trigger industrial delays.

The warning from the U.S. Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) comes as aerospace firms are more exposed to unexpected regulatory or economic hiccups following the COVID-19 crisis.

The standards would curb the flow of potentially damaging soot particles and do not take effect until the start of 2023.

But executives warn an already overstretched supply chain needs clarity long before then to avoid disruption. And they complain that a process involving two Washington agencies is moving too slowly, while Europe has already taken action.

""Any delay to regulatory implementation would create uncertainty, potentially significantly impacting our supply chain, airline deliveries, and damage U.S. industry’s overall global competitiveness,"" said Leslie Riegle, AIA assistant vice-president of civil aviation in response to a Reuters query.

The rules must be vetted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which expects to produce a final rule by September 2022.

But industry officials say the EPA's timetable means the deadline could be placed at risk because the changes must also be signed off by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

It is not clear when the FAA would complete its work, but industry sources say it is likely to take several months. After that, they say, companies would need further time to adapt.

The United States is home to two of the world’s three biggest engine makers, General Electric (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp's Pratt & Whitney.

GE said it encourages the administration ""to accelerate its rule making"" so that manufacturers have ""clear standards for demonstrating compliance prior to the 2023 deadline.""

Pratt & Whitney declined to comment.

UNUSUAL WORKAROUND

Both agencies, EPA and FAA, said they are working towards completing the process by the time the global standard becomes effective at the beginning of 2023.

Still, questions over whether the deadline will be met have prompted some executives to contemplate an unusual workaround by seeking approvals indirectly from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the FAA's counterpart in Europe.

Such a step is possible because of the interconnected nature of the aerospace industry. But it would need the involvement of the FAA and could create extra work and costs for U.S. manufacturers, a senior industry source said.

The proposal comes at a time when U.S. regulators are seeing their traditional aviation leadership increasingly diluted after a crisis over the design and approval of Boeing (NYSE: )'s 737 MAX.

""Any actions EASA may take on this matter will be coordinated closely with the FAA,"" an EASA spokesperson said. The FAA did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the potential workaround.

The UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), whose governing council adopted the new global standards in 2020, has said they will reduce the environmental and health impact of sooty emissions known as non-volatile particulate matter.

ICAO cannot impose its will on governments, so the United States, Europe and other countries that produce planes must translate the global engine standards into national rules.

EASA said European companies had already begun submitting applications aimed at complying with the rules, which apply to engines supplying at least 6,000 pounds of thrust that are in production starting from 2023 and new designs after that.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusiveaerospace-firms-warn-of-snags-over-us-engine-rule-delays-2612974,0.068,0.873,0.059,-0.5847

(Reuters) - Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, which has commercial aircraft makers Boeing (NYSE: ) and Airbus as customers, expects to face inflation pressure in the coming years, its chief executive officer said on Wednesday.

With the cost of raw materials and precious metals going up, the company would see a little bit of pressure, CEO Gregory Hayes said at the Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) Laguna Conference.

Hayes, however, added that higher costs would take a while to make its way to the customers in the form of price increases due to Raytheon (NYSE: )'s long-term supply agreements.

""The shortages out there are real, especially on the logistics side... and inflation, especially on the commodity side, is real. And we're starting to see it on the labor side as well.""

The U.S. aerospace manufacturer, which raised its full-year profit forecast in July on the back of higher demand for its commercial engines, spare parts and aftermarket services, said it continues to see the trend despite concerns from the Delta variant.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday removed $1 billion in military funding for Israel from legislation to fund the U.S. government after objections from liberals in the House of Representatives, but party leaders pledged to bring the matter up again later this week.

Some House Democrats objected to a provision in a stopgap spending bill to provide the additional funding so Israel can replenish its ""Iron Dome"" missile-defense system. The U.S. company Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp produces many Iron Dome components.

The House is debating legislation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-vote-tuesday-fund-govt-through-dec-3-raise-debt-limit-2021-09-21 to fund the federal government through Dec. 3 and raise the nation's borrowing limit.

The dispute forced the House Rules Committee to adjourn briefly before leaders of the Appropriations Committee pledged that funding for the Israeli system would be included in a defense spending bill later this year. That could set the stage for another dispute over military aid for Israel.

On Tuesday evening, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he would bring a bill to the House floor later this week that would fully fund the missile-defense system, and he expected it to pass. ""We ought to do it ... it is absolutely essential,"" Hoyer said.

Democratic Representative Jamaal Bowman, one of the Democrats who had concerns about the provision, said earlier that House members had not been given enough time to consider the matter.

""The problem is leadership (will) just throw something on our table, give us about five minutes to decide what we're going to do and then tries to move forward with it,"" Bowman told reporters.

The United States has already provided more than $1.6 billion for Israel to develop and build the Iron Dome system, according to a U.S. Congressional Research Service report last year. The funding reflects perennially strong support for aid to Israel among both Democrats and Republicans.

Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said in a statement that the removal of the funding was ""a technical postponement"" and he had been assured by U.S. Democratic leaders that funds for Iron Dome would be transferred soon.

Some liberal Democrats objected to U.S.-Israel policy this year, citing the many Palestinian casualties after Israel struck back following Hamas rocket attacks in May. Israel said most of the 4,350 rockets fired from Gaza during the conflict were blown out of the sky by Iron Dome interceptors.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/military-aid-for-israel-removed-from-us-bill-to-fund-government-2622656,0.062,0.889,0.049,-0.8519

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of the largest United States aerospace and defense companies are united in their effort to comply with the Biden administration's coronavirus vaccine mandate for U.S. workers and await further government guidance, their industry group said in a statement seen by Reuters on Thursday.

Last week major defense contractor Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, the maker of Tomahawk missiles, mandated its 125,000 U.S. employees get vaccinated after President Joe Biden announced policies requiring employers with more than 100 workers to have them inoculated or tested weekly.

The Aerospace Industries Association's board, chaired by Northrop Grumman (NYSE: )'s chief Kathy Warden, includes the CEOs of Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) Co, Leidos Holdings (NYSE: ) Inc, General Dynamics Corp (NYSE: ) and Raytheon (NYSE: ) Technologies.

""America's aerospace and defense industry stands together as we prepare to implement the new federal vaccine requirement, while working with our government partners as they develop detailed guidance,"" Eric Fanning, the association's president, said in the statement seen by Reuters.

""Throughout the pandemic, AIA members have expanded benefits and implemented extensive measures designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 as our essential work continued,"" Fanning said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration will investigate the possible national security risks of over-relying on imports of certain magnets used in fighter aircraft and missile guidance systems as part of a global supply chain review, the Commerce Department on Friday.

The neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) permanent magnets are used in a variety of other equipment, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, computer hard drives, audio equipment and MRI devices, it added.

NdFeB magnets are a type of rare earth magnet essential to building weapons, including Javelin missiles made by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp and Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ). Nearly all of the world's production of these specialized magnets takes place China. The United States long ago ceded its position as the world's largest manufacturer of the magnets, even though a U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NYSE: ) scientist invented them in the early 1980s. Reuters reported in late 2019 that the Pentagon had been seeking proposals to cache a rotating six-month supply of NdFeB magnets. The move was criticized at the time for not offering financial support for NdFeB magnet manufacturing, which industry analysts and executives saw as a short-sighted misstep. The Pentagon has funded some U.S. rare earth mining projects, including one in California operated by MP Materials Inc. MP relies on China for final processing of its rare earths, but has said it is working towards full processing at its mine and eventually making rare earth magnets in the United States.

The Las Vegas-based company said it looks ""forward to participating"" in the Commerce Department review and that it ""holds a deep conviction that private entities in the United States can achieve commercial (rare earth) success."" A bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives last month would extend tax credits to companies that domestically produce rare earth magnets. The Commerce Department called for submissions of public comment related to the probe to be submitted through Nov. 21, and has until June 18 to notify President Joe Biden if it finds the ""magnets are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.""

It said the magnet probe is the first such one launched under the Biden administration, which had initiated a widespread supply chain review to address bottlenecks affecting numerous industries, including transportation, logistics, construction materials and housing.

U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement the probe would help ""determine whether U.S. reliance on imports for this critical product is a threat to our national security.""",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/us-to-probe-some-imported-magnets-as-part-of-supply-chain-review-2626211,0.043,0.901,0.057,0.7925

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has tested an air-breathing hypersonic weapon capable of speeds faster than five times the speed of sound, marking the first successful test of the class of weapon since 2013, the Pentagon said on Monday.

The test took place as the United States and its global rivals quicken their pace to build hypersonic weapons - the next generation of arms that rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms.

In July, Russia said it had successfully tested a Tsirkon(Zircon) hypersonic cruise missile, a weapon President Vladimir Putin has touted as part of a new generation of missile systems without equal in the world.

The free flight test of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) occurred last week, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, said in a statement.

""This brings us one step closer to transitioning HAWC to a program of record that offers next generation capability to the U.S. military,"" said Andrew Knoedler, HAWC program manager in DARPA's Tactical Technology Office. There is no target date for that transition, but Knoedler told Reuters, ""we are readying our next vehicles and working toward additional flight tests later in the year.""

Hypersonic weapons travel in the upper atmosphere at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 6,200 kilometers (3,853 miles) per hour.

""The missile, built by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), was released from an aircraft seconds before its Northrop Grumman (NYSE: ) scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet) engine kicked on,"" DARPA said.

""The DoD (Department of Defense) has identified hypersonic weapons and counter-hypersonic capabilities as the highest technical priorities for our nation's security,"" said Wes Kremer, president of Raytheon (NYSE: )'s Missiles & Defense business unit.

""The United States, and our allies, must have the ability to deter the use of these weapons and the capabilities to defeat them,"" he said.

""Investments in hypersonic strike have begun to pay dividends, answering the progress already made by the likes of Russia and China,"" Tom Karako, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Reuters.

In 2019, Raytheon teamed up with Northrop Grumman to develop and produce engines for hypersonic weapons. Northrop's scramjet engine technology uses the vehicle's high speed to forcibly compress incoming air before combustion to enable sustained flight at hypersonic speeds.

""The HAWC vehicle operates best in oxygen-rich atmosphere, where speed and maneuverability make it difficult to detect in a timely way. It could strike targets much more quickly than subsonic missiles and has significant kinetic energy even without high explosives,"" DARPA said in a statement.

Dan Olson, vice president of Northrop Grumman's Weapon Systems Division, said ""decades of learning advanced manufacturing techniques and industry partnerships helped us define what is now possible.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-successfully-flight-tests-raytheon-hypersonic-weapon--pentagon-2627675,0.085,0.837,0.078,-0.1154

BOSTON (Reuters) -Airbus is sticking to its quest for record jet output after airlines reported glimmers of a post-pandemic recovery this week, and believes engine makers who have questioned its most ambitious proposals will be ""unable to resist"" demand.

Airbus has said it hopes to almost double jet production ina few years as borders reopen. Engine makers fear doing so tooquickly could upset their own recovery, by forcing existing jetsinto retirement rather than their repair shops. Interviewed at the airline industry's main annual event,Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer held out theprospect that Airbus would play on fierce competition betweenengine makers as it aims to secure future output of its A320neo. ""There will be engines. That is the beauty of having enginecompetition in the programme,"" he told Reuters on the sidelinesof a meeting of the International Air Transport Association, the first such industry gathering since the pandemic. ""There is a lot of rhetoric ... (but) at the end of the dayif customers ... demand more modern airplanes ... no enginemaker in the world is going to be able to resist the call ofnature. So I’m not concerned about it.” Airbus is sold out of its A320neo series until 2026, he said. In May, Airbus issued a mix of firm targets and scenariosthat could lift narrowbody A320-family output to 75 jets a monthby 2025 from about 40 this year, and 60 pre-COVID. The head of France's Safran (PA: ), part of the CFM engineventure with General Electric (NYSE: ), said earlier this year hewas not sure whether rates above 60 could be sustained. Also speaking in July, Greg Hayes, CEO of Pratt & Whitneyparent Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), expressed surprise at""pretty aggressive"" Airbus output plans. Both engine makers offer competing engines on the A320neo,the most-sold Airbus jet which competes with the Boeing (NYSE: ) 737 MAX. 'NO OVERPRODUCTION' Asked if Airbus had given up on studying the possibility ofincreasing A320neo output beyond the most recent firm target of63 a month to 70 or 75, Scherer said: ""absolutely not"". He added: ""It is a scenario right now. It is not a committedplan. But it is a sizing exercise that we must do because itcorresponds to demand – verified demand, not theoretical demand– that we are experiencing, including in meetings we are havingright here.”

While IATA discussed tougher climate pledges, airlines,suppliers and leasing companies mingled behind the sceneshaunted by the losses and overdue payments left by the industry's worst ever crisis, while reporting some interest in new jets. Scherer said conversations were beginning to turn towardsrecovery after a spate of restructurings of plane orders. ""The realisation that the world is expecting movementtowards more sustainable, more eco-friendly flying isaccelerating the need for the most modern airplanes, he said. Scherer addressed some suppliers' concerns that Airbus wouldrace to build jets to meet that demand, but only temporarily,leaving them to absorb costly capacity if the recovery falters. ""I think recent history has shown Airbus has been able tomanage its supply and demand very, very rigorously almost to thedot on the right spot,"" Scherer said. ""You have to trust that we will continue to do that in thefuture and not shoot ourselves in the foot by overproducingairplanes that we can’t sell.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/airbus-exec-says-wary-engine-makers-will-meet-demand-for-new-jets-2636091,0.064,0.897,0.039,-0.8882

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon wants defense contractors to cut the ultimate cost of hypersonic weapons, the head of research and development said on Tuesday, as the next generation of super-fast missiles being developed currently cost tens of millions per unit.

""We need to figure out how to drive towards more affordable hypersonics,"" Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Heidi Shyu told reporters at the Association of United States Army conference in Washington. She said cost was something she ""would like to help industry focus on.""

Currently, the U.S. uses cruise missiles which are mature technologies costing less than $5 million per unit to strike deep into enemy territory. But cruise missiles are inferior to hypersonic weapons because they have a shorter range, are far slower and more vulnerable to being detected and shot down.

Both Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) are working on hypersonic weapons for the Pentagon.

The Pentagon's budget request in the 2022 fiscal year for hypersonic research was $3.8 billion which was up from $3.2 billion they year before.

In September, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency successfully tested an air-breathing hypersonic weapon capable of speeds faster than five times the speed of sound. It was the first successful test of the class of weapon since 2013.

Hypersonic weapons travel in the upper atmosphere at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 6,200 kilometers (3,853 miles) per hour.

Shyu said ""if things start to progress in success stories and as we start to buy more than onesies twosies the price curve will come down.""

(Reuters) -Honeywell International Inc said on Wednesday it will require employees at all its U.S. offices and some manufacturing locations to be vaccinated against COVID-19 under an executive order from President Joe Biden for federal contractors.

Other government contractors including Boeing (NYSE: ) Co, International Business Machines (NYSE: ) Corp and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp have also mandated vaccines, with the White House last month setting Dec. 8 as the vaccination deadline https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-white-house-wants-millions-government-contractors-vaccinated-by-dec-8-2021-09-24 for millions of employees of federal contractors.

""The vaccination mandate applies to all Honeywell (NASDAQ: ) locations within the U.S. and its territories that support U.S. government contract work. This includes all U.S. office locations,"" the conglomerate said.

However, manufacturing sites not supporting government contracts are excluded from the mandate, Honeywell said. The company has 41,000 employees in the United States.

U.S. defense contractor Leidos Holdings (NYSE: ) also said on Wednesday that its employees must be fully vaccinated or provide a negative COVID-19 test result to access the company's facilities from Oct. 1.

Ship and submarine builder Huntington Ingalls (NYSE: ) Industries Inc said a vaccine would be required to stay employed.

""While we are discussing the effects of this mandate with our union partners, it will be a condition of continued employment for our workforce to be fully vaccinated"" by December 8, Chris Kastner Huntington Ingalls' chief operating officer wrote in a memo to employees posted on a company website on September 29.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE: ) said on Thursday the majority of its U.S. workforce must show proof of vaccination against COVID-19 under President Joe Biden's federal contractor executive order.

Verizon said thousands of non-union U.S. employees must be fully vaccinated by Dec. 8 under the executive order.

Verizon, a federal contractor, said it was in discussions with its unions about vaccination requirements for 30,000 U.S. unionized employees.

The company said retail employees and some other workers must be vaccinated by Feb. 1. Contractors, vendors, visitors and new hires who enter Verizon U.S. facilities must be fully vaccinated by Jan. 1.

The vast majority of Verizon's 130,000 employees worldwide are in the United States. The vaccine mandates will apply to nearly all its non-union employees.

Some ""home-based"" Verizon Consumer Group and others are excluded, the telecommunications company said.

""While we respect that within our workforce there are people with different beliefs and perspectives related to COVID-19 and the vaccine, we must comply with the government’s requirements, including those for federal contractors,"" Verizon said.

A growing number of federal contractors are complying with the Dec. 8 deadline.

Union Pacific Corp (NYSE: ), the top U.S. railroad operator, said on Wednesday it will require its 31,000 U.S. employees to be vaccinated.

Last month, U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak said it will require nearly all of its 18,000 employees be fully vaccinated by Nov. 22.

Boeing (NYSE: ) Co, another federal contractor, said on Tuesday it will require COVID-19 vaccination for its 125,000 U.S. employees.

Major U.S. airlines also have said they will also meet the deadline imposed on federal contractors, including American Airlines (NASDAQ: ), Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ) Co, JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: ) Corp and Alaska Airlines, as has aircraft parts manufacturer Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: ).

The White House announced the Dec. 8 deadline for employees of federal contractors last month after Reuters reported it. The requirement is expected to cover millions of workers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Pentagon's hypersonic weapon programs suffered a setback on Thursday when a booster rocket carrying a hypersonic weapon failed, people briefed on the test result said.

The test was intended to validate aspects of one of the Pentagon's hypersonic glide vehicles in development, two of the people said.

Hypersonic glide vehicles are launched from a rocket in the upper atmosphere before gliding to a target at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 3,853 miles (6,200 kilometers) per hour.

In a separate series of tests conducted on Wednesday, the U.S. Navy and Army tested hypersonic weapon component prototypes. That test successfully ""demonstrated advanced hypersonic technologies, capabilities, and prototype systems in a realistic operating environment,"" the Pentagon said in a statement.

The United States and its global rivals have quickened their pace to build hypersonic weapons - the next generation of arms that rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms.

U.S. President Joe Biden expressed concern on Wednesday about Chinese hypersonic missiles, days after a media report that Beijing had tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic glide weapon.

Glide bodies are different from their air-breathing hypersonic weapon cousins which use scramjet engine technology and the vehicle's high speed to forcibly compress incoming air before combustion to enable sustained flight at hypersonic speeds. An air-breathing hypersonic weapon was successfully tested in September.

Companies such as Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) are working to develop the hypersonic weapon capability for the United States.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/rocket-failure-delays-us-hypersonic-weapon-test-sources-2651541,0.102,0.843,0.055,-0.9246

PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus has rebuffed calls by aircraft leasing companies to temper plans to almost double production of its best-selling A320 jet family, telling them its ambitions are justified by expectations for post-pandemic demand, industry sources said.

Major lessors have joined engine makers in warning Airbus that an aggressive output increase to a new peak above 70 aircraft a month could upset the market and hurt plane values while a recovery from the coronavirus crisis remains fragile.

The latest approach came in separate letters to Airbus from at least two of the world's largest leasing companies, the sources said, confirming a Financial Times report.

Airbus has responded by saying it is sticking to its plans, which involve a firm target of 64 A320-family jets a month in the second quarter of 2023, along with studies to raise monthly output to 70 in early 2024 and 75 by 2025.

That compares with about 40 A320-family jets a month now and what was then a record level of 60 before the COVID-19 crisis.

Airbus told leasing companies complaining about the plans that ""demand is there"", two people familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

An Airbus spokesperson declined to comment on confidential correspondence but said: ""We continue to work on our commercial aircraft production ramp-up in line with the planning communicated in May 2021.""

Shares in the planemaker fell more than 2% on Monday.

Representatives of lessors AerCap and Avolon, which are reported to have written to Airbus, were not immediately available for comment.

The exchange deepens a row over the speed of recovery from a pandemic-induced travel slump that led to thousands of planes being grounded in the past year.

Although arguments over right levels of supply are common between jetmakers and lessors who rely on maintaining the value of planes, tensions have escalated since the pandemic as lessors have collectively overtaken airlines as the biggest buyers.

""It’s the normal tension, but Airbus have to play the game carefully,"" said one senior industry source. ""Lessors always take their aircraft; you don’t want to alienate them too much.""

Industry pioneer Steven Udvar-Hazy, executive chairman of Air Lease (NYSE: ) Corp, warned of the dangers of overproduction at an Airline Economics conference last month.

NO SUPPLIER AGREEMENT

While most analysts agree that any recovery will benefit small jets such as the A320 and Boeing (NYSE: ) 737 first, the dispute focuses on whether it makes sense to raise output sharply before a glut of parked jets has returned to service - a step needed to rescue their earning potential for lessors and engine makers.

Airbus says its demand forecasts are based on verified contracts and that the supply chain needs transparency over its future production plans to finance future capacity.

However, it has yet to reach agreement with its suppliers over the most ambitious part of its plan.

""There is no agreement beyond 64 (a month); discussions are still happening,"" one supplier said.

Others cautioned that even those output levels must confront post-crisis challenges over labour, shipping and inflation.

Airbus aims to reach monthly output of 45 A320-family jets this quarter as a stepping stone towards its goals, but suppliers say the flow of parts is steady for now at about 40.

Suppliers are worried that they may be forced to invest in more machinery and factory space only to see demand fail to recover as quickly as Airbus hopes, while lessors fear that any excess output could chop years off the life of jets that they rent out, forcing them to take a hit on their balance sheets.

Engine makers fret that raising output of new jets too quickly could upset their own recovery by forcing existing jets into retirement rather than their repair shops.

Airbus this month suggested it would exploit competition between engine makers CFM and Pratt & Whitney to secure its output plans.

Both Safran (PA: ), which co-owns CFM with General Electric (NYSE: ), and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), which controls Pratt, voiced concerns over jet output at mid-year.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/airbus-rebuffs-lessor-complaints-about-plans-to-lift-jet-output-2653734,0.088,0.84,0.072,-0.8571

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Jet engine maker General Electric (NYSE: ) Co is aligned with ""near-term"" plans of both Airbus and Boeing (NYSE: ) to ramp up production, its Chief Executive Larry Culp said on Tuesday.

Culp, however, declined to comment on Airbus' plan to go beyond an immediate ramp-up and almost double production of its best-selling A320 jets by 2025. This plan has drawn criticism from engine makers and aircraft leasing companies about the risk of overproduction during a fragile airline industry recovery from the pandemic.

""We will talk about those conversations with them directly behind closed doors,"" Culp told Reuters in an interview. ""There is no need to have that conversation publicly at this time.""

In May, Airbus announced a firm target of increasing A320-family production from 40 planes a month to 64 by the second quarter of 2023 and said it was asking suppliers to enable a ""scenario"" of 70 a month by the first quarter of 2024. The planemaker also said it was investigating rates as high as 75 by 2025.

Industry sources say suppliers have agreed to support the firm goal of 64 a month but have yet to reach agreement on supporting the higher rates, fearing that demand would fail to meet expectations.

Earlier, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Chief Executive Greg Hayes said he was skeptical whether the market would support Airbus rates as high as 75 a month.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Hopes of an imminent breakthrough in deliveries of Boeing (NYSE: ) Co's 787 jetliner were fading on Tuesday after a top supplier reported a lull in activity and two industry sources said the jetmaker continued to wade through lingering factory problems.

Boeing shares fell 1.4% on the eve of quarterly earnings due on Wednesday, reaching their lowest level since Sept. 21 as uncertainty continues to plague its main commercial programs.

More than 100 long-haul 787s are parked, locking up an estimated $9 billion in cash, after a series of manufacturing issues over the past two years compounded weak demand.

""There is a substantial risk that Boeing will recognize a charge related to the program at Q3 results,"" Bernstein analyst Doug Harned wrote last week.

The 787 problems have stifled a crucial source of cash as Boeing's main cash cow, the 737 MAX, recovers gradually from a two-year safety crisis triggered by fatal crashes.

""We are progressing through our comprehensive inspections and reviews, and will continue to take the time necessary to meet the highest standards, while coordinating closely with our suppliers and customers,"" a Boeing spokesperson said on Tuesday when asked about the 787 issues.

While the MAX received Western approvals late last year, Boeing faces renewed uncertainty over the timing of its re-entry to service in China, which drives a quarter of its sales.

China had been expected to approve the MAX in November but chances are growing this will slip to next year, sources said.

China's regulator did not respond to a request for comment.

A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment on China or the MAX.

Although Boeing and Chinese regulators recently carried out a successful test flight, the clearance has become tangled in diplomatic tensions with the United States.

Boeing said earlier this year it would deliver fewer than half of the 100 or so 787s in its inventory this year, instead of the ""vast majority"" previously expected. So far this year it has delivered 14.

Hopes are fading that a meaningful number could be delivered before year-end, one of the industry sources said, although a handful of deliveries could not be ruled out.

One supplier said Boeing had not given parts makers an indication of its timing one way or the other, leaving uncertainty over the timetable for deliveries.

Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), which supplies a raft of systems, said on Tuesday it was not shipping anything for the 787.

Boeing has been grappling with manufacturing flaws that produced structural defects in the 787 and have twice halted deliveries, with the latest stoppage ongoing since May.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/uncertainty-dogs-787-deliveries-max-approval-ahead-of-boeing-q3-2656367,0.059,0.878,0.063,0.4588

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon successfully tested a booster rocket motor on Thursday designed to power a launch vehicle carrying a hypersonic weapon aloft, the Navy said.

The United States and its global rivals have intensified their drive to build hypersonic weapons - the next generation of arms that rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms. Defense contractors hope to capitalize as they make the weapons and develop new detection and defeat mechanisms.

This week, the top U.S. military officer confirmed a Chinese hypersonic weapons test that military experts say appears to show Beijing's pursuit of an Earth-orbiting system designed to evade American missile defenses.

""We are on schedule for the upcoming flight test of the full common hypersonic missile,"" said Vice Admiral Johnny Wolfe Jr, Director, Navy's Strategic Systems Programs, lead designer on the program. That flight test, of the combined boost rocket and hypersonic weapon, is slated to happen before autumn 2022.

Last week in Kodiak, Alaska, the U.S. failed a hypersonic weapon test when the booster failed.

U.S. military services will use the common hypersonic missile as a base to develop individual weapon systems and launchers tailored for launch from sea or land.

The common hypersonic missile will consist of the first stage solid rocket motor as part of a new missile booster combined with the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (CHGB).

This static fire test marked the first time the first stage solid rocket motor included a thrust vector control system, the Navy said. Thrust vector control systems allow the rocket motors to be maneuverable in flight.

The U.S. Navy's Strategic Systems Programs conducted two prior tests of the solid rocket motor used in the development of the Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) offensive hypersonic strike capability and the Army's Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW).

AUSTIN/SEATTLE (Reuters) - In Wichita, Kansas, nearly half of the roughly 10,000 employees at aircraft companies Textron Inc (NYSE: ) and Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: ) remain unvaccinated against COVID-19, risking their jobs in defiance of a federal mandate, according to a union official.

""We're going to lose a lot of employees over this,"" said Cornell Beard, head of the local Machinists union district. Many workers did not object to the vaccines as such, he said, but were staunchly opposed to what they see as government meddling in personal health decisions.

The union district has hired a Texas-based lawyer to assist employees and prepare potential lawsuits against the companies should requests for medical or religious exemptions to vaccination be denied.

A life-long Democrat, Beard said he would no longer vote for the party. ""They'll never get another vote from me and I'm telling the workers here the same thing.""

The clock is ticking for companies that want to continue gaining federal contracts under an executive order by Democratic President Joe Biden, which requires all contractor employees be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Dec. 8.

That means federal contract workers need to have received their last COVID-19 shot at least two weeks before the deadline to gain maximum protection, according to U.S. government guidance.

With a three-week gap between shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, workers must get the first jab by Wednesday. If the government holds fast to its deadline, it is already too late to choose Moderna (NASDAQ: )'s vaccine, which is given in two doses four weeks apart. Workers could opt to get Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: )'s single-shot vaccine until Nov. 24 to meet the deadline.

Vaccines remain by far the most effective way to prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, particularly faced with the extremely contagious Delta variant of the virus that can cause infections even among those fully vaccinated.

Despite vocal opposition from some, vaccine mandates have been effective at shrinking the rates of the unvaccinated and convincing the reluctant to roll up their sleeves.

Several big employers such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ), 3M and airlines including American Airlines (NASDAQ: ) and JetBlue have imposed mandates. In some industries, including among food workers, unions have supported vaccine requirements.

But the mandate has stirred protests from workers in industries across the country, as well as from Republican state officials.

Opposition to the mandate could potentially lead to thousands of U.S. workers losing their jobs and imperil an already sluggish economic recovery, union leaders, workers and company executives said.

More legal clashes are likely over how companies decide requests for vaccination exemptions.

For the companies, time is getting tight, though the Biden administration has signaled federal contractors will not have to immediately lay off unvaccinated workers who miss the Dec. 8 deadline.

Under government guidance published on Monday, companies will have flexibility over how to implement the mandate, which may allow them to avoid mass firings.

""A covered contractor should determine the appropriate means of enforcement with respect to its employee,"" the guidance said.

For Boeing (NYSE: ) Co in the United States, more than 7,000 workers have applied for religious exemptions and around 1,000 are seeking medical exemptions, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. That amounts to some 6% of the planemaker's roughly 125,000 U.S employees.

'ILLEGAL, IMMORAL AND IMPRACTICAL'

At a rally last week outside Boeing property in Auburn, south of Seattle, many of the three dozen workers gathered in driving rain said they would rather be escorted off Boeing property on Dec. 8 than take a vaccine. Others said they would pursue early retirement.

""The mandate is illegal, immoral and impractical,"" said one veteran Boeing program analyst who attended the rally. ""We are standing together against a company and government trampling on our rights.""

Many legal experts have said vaccine mandates in the interest of public health are legal. The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected several challenges to mandates, with the high court last week turning away a healthcare worker who sought a religious exemption to a COVID-19 vaccine mandate.

The rebellion has put Boeing executives in a bind. The company could lose skilled staff, but must comply with a presidential order.

A Boeing spokesperson said the company was committed to maintaining a safe working environment for its employees.

The order's provision for religious and medical exemptions is causing more tension.

Two Textron workers who requested religious exemptions told Reuters the company's human resources representatives quizzed them on the name of their church leaders and asked detailed questions about their faith.

Textron declined to respond to questions, but in a statement said it was obligated to comply with Biden's order and was taking steps to do so.

""Employees who are unable to receive the COVID-19 vaccination due to a medical condition or sincerely held religious belief are being provided an opportunity to request an accommodation from this requirement,"" Textron said.

Spirit AeroSystems did not respond to a request for comment.

Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: )' CEO Greg Hayes last week warned the U.S. defense firm will lose ""several thousand"" employees because of the mandate.

A group representing FedEx Corp (NYSE: ), United Parcel Service Inc (NYSE: ) and other cargo carriers said it would be virtually impossible to have all their workforces vaccinated by the deadline.

Some companies have imposed vaccine mandates even absent immediate government regulation.

Mercedes-Benz USA, the U.S. unit of German carmaker Daimler AG (DE: ) which is not a U.S. government contractor, told employees in an October email seen by Reuters that proof of vaccination against COVID-19 would become a condition of employment beginning Jan. 4.

The carmaker said it implemented the move in anticipation of a separate U.S. government vaccine mandate that would apply to businesses with at least 100 employees, affecting some 80 million workers nationwide.

Less than half of the company's workers at U.S. import processing centers are vaccinated and many refuse to get a shot, according to a source familiar with the matter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar filed legislation on Friday seeking to block the sale of $650 million air-to-air missiles to Saudi Arabia, the first major arms sale to the kingdom during President Joe Biden's administration.

Omar said she filed the measure, known as a joint resolution of disapproval, because of Saudi Arabia's role in Yemen's civil war, considered one of the world's war humanitarian disasters, and its human rights record.

The Biden administration announced on Nov. 4 that it had approved the sale of https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-state-dept-okays-650-million-potential-air-to-air-missile-deal-saudi-arabia-2021-11-04 280 air-to-air missiles valued at up to $650 million. Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) makes the missiles.

""We should never be selling human rights abusers weapons, but we certainly should not be doing so in the midst of a humanitarian crisis they are responsible for. Congress has the authority to stop these sales, and we must exercise that power,"" Omar said in a statement.

The measure's prospects for stopping the sale are slim, since it would have to pass the U.S. Senate and survive a likely veto. But Omar's action underscores continuing wariness about weapons sales to Riyadh among some lawmakers, despite the Biden administration's intention to limit weapons sales to the kingdom to ""defensive"" equipment.

While Saudi Arabia is an important partner in the Middle East, U.S. lawmakers have refused to approve many military sales for the kingdom without assurances U.S. equipment would not be used to kill civilians.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-lawmaker-looks-to-block-first-major-saudi-arms-deal-under-biden-2678319,0.142,0.805,0.053,-0.9818

Investing.com – Airbus stock (PA: ) traded 2% higher in Paris Monday as the European giant revealed new orders for both passenger and military planes at the Dubai airshow over the weekend.

The order for passenger aircraft comprises delivery of 255 A321neo family planes to airlines that are part of private equity company Indigo Partners' portfolio. The companies are Hungary-based Wizz Air (LON: ), U.S.-based Frontier and Latin America-based Volaris and JetSMART.

The planes, which are Airbus' most recent narrow-body plane, can seat between 170 to 220 passengers. The order size is estiimated at $30 billion before the usual industry discounts. Airbus didn't disclose any financial details.

The order adds to evidence that airlines are regaining confidence in their outlook after over a year and a half devastated by the pandemic. However, there is still no visible pickup yet for widebody aircraft, indicating that the recovery in long-haul is still expected to lag that in regional traffic.

In another order disclosed Sunday, UAE has ordered two additional Airbus A330 multirole tanker transport for its defense forces.

The five-day Dubai air show ends Thursday.

(Reuters) - Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: ) and Textron (NYSE: ) are likely to be the most hit among major U.S. aerospace and defense companies, as they face the loss of several employees once the mandate requiring federal contractors to be vaccinated comes into effect in January, brokerage Jefferies (NYSE: ) said on Wednesday.

Spirit and Textron would bear the brunt as a big chunk of their manufacturing units are located in Wichita, Kansas, where just 53% of working age individuals are fully vaccinated, Jefferies said.

Gulfstream, General Dynamic's aerospace unit, is also heavily exposed as only 48% of the working-age population around Savannah is vaccinated, said Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu.

The White House earlier this month extended a deadline for federal contractors to get vaccinated from Dec. 8 to Jan. 4. There are concerns that the mandate could compound worker shortages, and alongside there has been a rise in strikes as workers take advantage of the tight labor market to demand more pay and better conditions.

Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) had warned last month that the it will lose 'several thousand' employees who refused to take COVID-19 vaccines

However, Jefferies believes Raytheon (NYSE: )'s Intelligence & Space is one of those best insulated as its headquarters are located in a region where 79% of the working-age population is vaccinated.

Jefferies analyst Kahyaoglu also said several questions remain around the vaccine mandate, including who would be liable if a supplier does not comply with the mandate and what could be the potential penalties.

""Additionally, it remains unknown whether costs related to vaccine-related loss of workers is an allowable cost for relief from the Federal government,"" the analyst added.

CHIAYI, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen lauded military cooperation with Washington on Thursday as she commissioned the first combat wing of F-16 fighters upgraded with U.S. help to bolster the island's defences during rising tensions between Taipei and Beijing.

Frequent Chinese and U.S. military exercises in the region have raised fears of conflict touched off by a crisis over democratically-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory.

Tsai told a ceremony at an air base in the southern Taiwanese city of Chiayi to unveil the first squadron of its most advanced F-16s, the F-16V, that the project showed the firm commitment of the Taiwan-U.S. partnership.

""I believe that as long as we adhere to the values of democracy and freedom, there will be more like-minded countries standing on the same front with us,"" she said, speaking on the same stage as the top U.S. diplomat in Taiwan, Sandra Oudkirk.

The United States has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is the island's main international backer and arms supplier, to Beijing's fury.

The T$110 billion ($3.96 billion) F-16 upgrade is led by manufacturer Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) and Taiwan's Aerospace Industrial Development Corp (AIDC), and is the latest example of military cooperation between Washington and Taipei.

Taiwan has been converting 141 F-16A/B jets into the F-16V type, 64 of which have already been upgraded, and has additionally ordered 66 new F-16Vs, which have new avionics, weapons and radar systems to better face down the Chinese air force, including its J-20 stealth fighter.

The F-16Vs can carry Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp's advanced AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missiles.

To a backdrop of dance music broadcast over the air base, the F-16s showed off their mettle with combat take offs and landings, and flying low in formation above the runway.

Tsai said that as more F-16Vs entered service, Taiwan's defences would be ""even stronger"".

Taiwan's air force is well trained but dwarfed by China's.

The United States in 2019 approved an $8 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, a deal that would take the island's F-16 fleet to more than 200 jets, the largest in Asia.

China has announced sanctions on Lockheed Martin for selling arms to Taiwan.

The heightened need for advanced defense systems owing to rising geopolitical tensions and proposed defense funding in its 2022 fiscal budget, should enable the aerospace and defense industry to grow substantially. Rising government contracts should benefit prominent players in this space — Raytheon (NYSE: ) (RTX) and Boeing (BA). But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE: ) and The Boeing Company (NYSE: ) are two well-established companies in the aerospace and defense industry. RTX provides advanced systems and services for commercial, military, and government customers worldwide. It operates through four segments — Collins Aerospace Systems; Pratt & Whitney; Raytheon Intelligence & Space; and Raytheon Missiles & Defense. On the other hand, BA designs, manufactures, and sells commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense systems, human space flight, and launch systems and services worldwide. The company operates through four segments — Commercial Airplanes (BCA); Defense, Space & Security (BDS); Global Services (BGS); and Boeing Capital (BCC).

The increasing hopes on the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for the fiscal year 2022 for funding $768 billion for military and national security programs and growing threats from China, Russia, and Iran have helped prominent companies operating in the aerospace and defense industry gain government contracts and investor attention lately. Moreover, massive efforts and funding to combat new generation hypervelocity missiles and deliver improved performance and safety are expected to benefit these companies substantially.

Investor optimism in this space is evident in the Fidelity Select Defense & Aerospace Portfolio’s (FSDAX) 8% gain over the past month versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 0.7% return.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus and Boeing (NYSE: ) Co will launch all-new successors to their best-selling single-aisle jets powered by hydrogen from around the middle of next decade, the head of a U.S. company that champions the fuel told Reuters.

The prediction by Paul Eremenko, chief executive of Universal Hydrogen, counters assertions by Boeing that it is too early to think about hydrogen for a future 737 successor, while Airbus strongly backs hydrogen but initially for smaller planes.

Eremenko, who spoke as part of the Reuters Next conference, is a former chief technology officer for Airbus and United Technologies, now part of Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ).

He co-founded Universal Hydrogen last year with plans to speed up the introduction of hydrogen, initially for 40-60-seat regional airplanes, based on fuel cells.

But Eremenko has also set his sights on breaking in to the busiest part of the aviation market, the 150-seat-plus single-aisles dominated by the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo.

""I think there will be a new airplane in that class from both aircraft manufacturers probably around the mid-2030s, which means they would need to make a decision on that by the late 2020s,"" Eremenko said.

""We want to make sure that the decision is to make that a hydrogen airplane.""

Boeing appears to have ruled that out. It said in July that hydrogen has a future but that significant hurdles must be overcome before it is widely used. It said sustainable aviation fuel offers the quickest and most effective potential.

'RHETORIC'

""Irrespective of the rhetoric that we hear today on this subject, I think by the time this is in service in the regional market ... in 2025 the tenor of the conversation is going to fundamentally change,"" Eremenko said.

""When it is visibly in commercial service ... I think it will be uncontroversial and irrefutable that the next generation single-aisle has to be a hydrogen airplane in the 2030s.""

Experts say the high cost of hydrogen, challenges of storing and super-cooling the gas and building a reliable and widespread supply system, as well as certification, must all be addressed.

Eremenko said Universal Hydrogen is in discussions with U.S. regulators to show hydrogen is safe.

Hydrogen-powered airplane flight is not new. The predecessor to America's NASA flew a modified bomber with one engine running on hydrogen in 1957. The Soviet Union flew a hydrogen-powered TU-155 airliner in 1988, again replacing kerosene in one engine.

""There is no real fundamental science to be done; there is no fundamental invention,"" Eremenko said. ""It is engineering, hard engineering, and a lot of engineering will need to happen over the next decade to make this possible.""

While Universal Hydrogen is looking at replacing turboprop engines on regional aircraft with retrofittable electrical ones powered by a hydrogen-based fuel cell, it aims to focus purely on supplying hydrogen if it penetrates the single-aisle market.

French-U.S. engine venture CFM, the biggest supplier of gas turbines for the single-aisle market, in June unveiled a radical open-bladed design capable of burning convention fuel or hydrogen from the mid-2030s.

Eremenko acknowledged a standoff over infrastructure for green hydrogen produced using renewable energy.

""Until you have a hydrogen airplane nobody is going to invest in the infrastructure and unless there is infrastructure the Boeings and Airbuses of this world aren't going to build a hydrogen airplane,"" he said.

Universal Hydrogen plans to test-fly a hydrogen-powered regional airplane next year, ""hopefully well before the end of the year,"" Eremenko added.

British-American firm ZeroAvia said in October it would team up with MHI RJ Aviation Group to cooperate in developing hydrogen-electric propulsion for regional jets.",https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/universal-hydrogen-ceo-sees-jetmakers-backing-new-fuel-2696582,0.012,0.925,0.063,0.9842

(Reuters) -Pratt & Whitney's improved version of the geared turbofan engine used by Airbus SE (OTC: )'s strong-selling A320neo jet family will help build backlog, the engine maker said on Thursday.

Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: )' Pratt said it will also meet the demands of its largest commercial customer, Airbus, which has asked suppliers to explore rates as high as 75 a month by 2025.

The GTF Advantage update comes with 4% higher thrust, 1% improved fuel burn, and can last longer between scheduled maintenance appointments. Pratt says the updated GTF will be the most powerful engine for the A320neo family when it enters service in January 2024.

“This is not a paper engine,"" Tom Pelland, Pratt senior vice president of GTF engines, told reporters at the company's media day in Connecticut. ""This is an engine we’re testing today.”

The development, reported by Reuters on Wednesday, comes as airlines are under pressure to slash emissions with engine makers eying longer-term advances like hybrid-electric propulsion to improve fuel efficiency.

Pelland said the GTF could deliver future double-digit improvements in efficiency, using new technologies, compared with the original engine launched in 2016 that improved fuel burn by 16%.

Pratt could not specify a timeframe for such an update.

Pratt faces rival CFM International, co-owned by France's Safran (PA: ) SA, and U.S.-based General Electric (NYSE: ), which leads in market share on the A320 program.

“We expect to continue to grow our backlog and keep our delivery share in about the same or better place,“ said Rick Deurloo, Pratt's chief customer officer.

Deurloo said the engine maker is not trying to grow its A320 market share of around 40% but wants to be more selective about finding airlines that are more likely to fly the planes.

Engine makers make most of their money over the life of an aircraft in the aftermarket.

The update could help win orders in China which has airports at high altitude, he said.

“There’s a lot of activity we suspect will happen in China next year,” he told Reuters.

Earlier in the day, French jet engine maker Safran said the worst of the coronavirus crisis was over but took a cautious view on long-term airline traffic in a continuing stand-off with Airbus over proposed increases in jetliner production.

Asked about Airbus' plans for 2023, Pratt & Whitney President Christopher Calio told reporters, “We’re going to meet the demands of our customer.”

Deurloo said Pratt hasn't yet set plans for the following two years.

“We have a general question around what that demand may actually be which is why we haven’t locked in for 2024 and 2025,"" Deurloo said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pratt-announces-update-of-a320neo-engine-2697505,0.039,0.888,0.073,0.848

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate rejected a resolution on Tuesday that would have prohibited the proposed sale of advanced medium range air-to-air missiles, missile launchers and other weapons and support to Saudi Arabia.

The vote was 67 to 30 against the resolution, which was introduced by Republicans Rand Paul and Mike Lee, as well as Bernie Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats.

While many U.S. lawmakers consider Saudi Arabia an important partner in the Middle East, members of Congress also have criticized the country for its involvement in the war in Yemen, a conflict considered one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters.

""Exporting more missiles to Saudi Arabia does nothing but further this conflict and pour more gasoline on already raging fire,"" Sanders said in a speech urging support for the resolution of disapproval.

They have refused to approve military sales for the kingdom without assurances U.S. equipment would not be used to kill civilians. Backers of the sale noted that President Joe Biden's administration has already barred U.S. sales of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia.

""I completely agree with the need to hold Saudi leadership accountable for a variety of actions... but I also believe that it is important that our security partners know that we will uphold our commitments,"" said Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

The weapons package, which was approved by the State Department as well as leaders of the Senate and House foreign affairs committees, would include 280 AIM-120C-7/C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM), 596 LAU-128 Missile Rail Launchers (MRL) along other equipment and support,

Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) makes the missiles.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Wednesday called for inspections and strengthening a key part for Boeing (NYSE: ) 777-200 airplanes equipped with Pratt & Whitney (PW) engines after an engine failure in February.

The FAA issued three proposed airworthiness directives, a move that will allow Boeing 777-200 airplanes equipped with PW4000 engines to return to service as soon as early 2022.

A fan blade failure prompted an engine to fail on a United Airlines 777-200 bound for Honolulu after takeoff from Denver on Feb. 20. The incident showered debris over nearby cities, but no one was injured and the plane safely returned to the airport.

The FAA said it was calling for strengthening engine cowlings, enhanced engine fan-blade inspection and inspection of other systems and components. The directives will require corrective action based on inspection results.

The FAA in February ordered immediate inspection of 777 planes with PW4000 engines before further flights after investigators found that a cracked fan blade on the United engine was consistent with metal fatigue.

United said the proposed directives ""are a good outcome for our industry and United customers."" It added ""many of the affected engines have already undergone these proposed inspections. We expect these aircraft to safely rejoin our fleet early next year.""

Boeing Co said in a statement it supports the FAA’s guidance on inspection requirements for Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines ""and will work with our customers and Pratt & Whitney through the process.""

Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp's Pratt & Whitney said on Wednesday the inspection of fan blades was ""already underway"" and could ""be performed in the field, on or near-wing by trained personnel."" It added the directive mandates ""guidance Pratt & Whitney has provided to customers.""

The FAA said ""further action is necessary to address the airplane-level implications and unsafe condition resulting from in-flight engine fan blade failures.""

United, the only U.S. operator of 777s with the PW4000 engine, has 52 of those planes that remain grounded.

United Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE: ) noted that the airline's voluntary grounding of those 52 planes was not cheap.

""That is a massively expensive decision to make - but we did it for safety,"" Kirby told a U.S. Senate panel last week.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/faa-issues-safety-directive-for-some-boeing-777200-engines-2721193,0.045,0.837,0.118,0.989

Global Smart Buildings Market to Reach US$111.5 Billion by the Year 2026Smart buildings refer to any structure that is integrated or retrofitted with Internet-enabled, inter-connected appliances and devices. Smart buildings are emerging into the spotlight for their ability to achieving net zero carbon reduction targets, increase energy efficiency, and save energy. By using technologies like AI, IoT, big data, blockchain to connect buildings, transport and infrastructure, smart buildings can create a new ecosystem that can utilize more renewable energy, minimize energy waste, and slash carbon emissions. The need to switch over to smart buildings has arisen owing to the numerous benefits and ability to overcome challenges faced by the world. They help improve occupant productiveness with lighting, air quality, thermal comfort, physical security and sanitation among others and above all minimize overheads and environmental impact when compared to non-connected buildings. They are expected to play big role in addressing climate change targets. Smart hospitals, healthcare facilities, office buildings, educational institutions, gyms and stadiums are all examples of smart buildings whose numbers are increasing across the world. Smart buildings use their intelligence for collecting data that is actionable from on-premise sensors, user devices, services and systems. The application of that data through machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) makes such buildings programmable and duly responsive to their users’ needs as also that of their managers. The network intelligence also helps in securing the network.

Amid the COVID-19 crisis, the global market for Smart Buildings estimated at US$63 Billion in the year 2020, is projected to reach a revised size of US$111.5 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 10.2% over the analysis period.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which assesses mergers to ensure they comply with antitrust law, has put off a vote on Lockheed Martin (NYSE: )'s purchase of Aerojet Rocketdyne for as much as two weeks, two people briefed on the matter said.

The vote had initially been scheduled for midweek, one of the people said, adding that the extension would allow the FTC more time to evaluate terms for the merger. Aerojet shares were up more than 3% in after-market trading on Tuesday as investors viewed the delay as a positive sign that the deal would go through.

The people spoke on condition of anonymity. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the FTC declined comment.

The deal has drawn criticism because it would give Lockheed - the No. 1 defense contractor - a dominant position over a vital piece of the U.S. missile industry. Rocket motors are used in everything from the homeland defensive missile system to Stinger missiles. Missile maker Raytheon (NYSE: ) has been an outspoken opponent of the proposed deal.

The $4.4 billion deal announced in late 2020 is Lockheed's first large acquisition under new Chief Executive Jim Taiclet, and would reshape the competitive landscape for solid rocket fuel missiles which are used with jets and drones.

(Reuters) -General Dynamics Corp on Wednesday had a mixed quarter as the defense giant missed analyst revenue estimates but beat their fourth-quarter profit estimates, helped by strong growth in its aerospace unit, even as supply chain bottlenecks and labor chain shortages lingered.

Shares were down 1% in pre-market trading on Wednesday.

U.S. President Joe Biden has not signaled he plans to slash the 2023 budget for General Dynamics (NYSE: )' biggest customer, the Pentagon, despite progressive Democrats calling for a reduction in military spending and the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Demand for business aviation stayed strong in the last three months of 2021, helped by easing travel restrictions, higher vaccination rates and the lure of private flights.

In the quarter the company delivered 39 Gulfstream business jets versus 40 a year ago. In October, the company said it planed to deliver 40 in the fourth quarter.

Sales in General Dynamics' aerospace unit which makes Gulfstream jets rose to $2.56 billion from $2.44 billion a year earlier, while overall revenue fell to $10.29 billion from $10.48 billion.

Net earnings fell to $952 million, or $3.39 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1 billion, or $3.49 per share, a year earlier.

Analysts, on average, expected the company to post a quarterly profit per share of $3.37, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

The company beat its own October annual earnings per share guidance of $11.50 by $0.05.

The results come a day after Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp beat analyst estimates for quarterly profit, encouraged by easing restrictions around the globe.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/general-dynamics-profit-falls-5-2748820,0.022,0.818,0.16,0.9932

(Reuters) -Northrop Grumman Corp missed fourth-quarter revenue estimates on Thursday as labor shortages and supply chain snarls hampered its ability to deliver components for defense products, including Lockheed Martin (NYSE: )'s F-35 jets.

The defense contractor's sales fell 15% in the final three months of 2021 to $8.64 billion, falling short of the average analyst estimate of $8.99 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

The drop was driven by a 25% decline in revenue from its aeronautics unit that makes the center fuselage for fighter jets and also reflected how the pandemic has hobbled manufacturers by disrupting supply chains.

Northrop (NYSE: )'s shares fell 1.7% before the bell as its 2022 forecast suggested the supply chain pressure was likely to continue. The company expects sales of between $36.2 billion and $36.6 billion this year, below estimates of $37.03 billion.

But its space systems business was a bright spot, with revenue rising 4% in the fourth quarter as countries ramped up investment in space exploration and satellite-based sensors.

Quarterly net earnings rose to $2.71 billion, or $17.14 per share, from $330 million, or $1.97 per share, a year ago, aided by a one-time gain on the sale of its IT services business.

On an adjusted basis, the company earned $6 per share, beating estimates of $5.96 per share.

Its total profit for 2021 more than doubled to $7 billion.

MONTREAL (Reuters) -Europe's Airbus and Quebec on Friday said they have agreed to a $1.2 billion investment deal that would allow the Canadian province to remain in the loss-making A220 jet program until the venture is likely to turn profitable.

Airbus would invest $900 mln, while Quebec would put $300 million into the program, according to a statement from the province's government.

The investment would help the A220 program globally to support an increase in production, Benoit Schultz, chief executive of Airbus' Canadian unit, told a press briefing. The A220 is built both at an Airbus plant in the Montreal area and at the Mobile facility in Alabama.

The A220, previously known as the CSeries, is a 110- to 130-seater aircraft, a little smaller than Airbus’s mainstay A320 jet. Reuters reported on the deal earlier, citing sources.

The province has faced criticism for repeated investments in the program.

Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said the program should be profitable by the middle of the decade.

Faury told reporters that COVID-19 weighed on cost-cutting efforts because it impeded production increases.

""We need volume to have these savings,"" he said.

Quebec Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said the A220 program has promise to turn the corner and generates key jobs for the province, Canada's aerospace hub.

The deal would help maintain the equivalent of 2,500 jobs.

The deal would defer by four years the period when Airbus buys out Quebec's 25% stake in the small jetliner from 2026 to 2030, and Fitzgibbon said that could be advantageous.

""At that time we're going to have a fair market value assessment and I'm very hopeful we're going to make money and recuperate the original investment,"" he said.

While the A220 has benefited from airlines' preference for relatively small jets during the pandemic, Airbus has yet to secure low enough prices for many of the plane's components to push the A220 project into the black.

Airbus was expected to use its global marketing network and higher purchasing power from suppliers to move the project into the black, but while sales have soared, industry sources say it has struggled to win the concessions it wants from suppliers.

In 2020, Canada's Bombardier (OTC: ) exited the program, the first all-new narrow-body jet in 30 years, after it was beset with delays and cost overruns.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/airbus-and-quebec-reach-investment-deal-for-a220-jet-program--sources-2757271,0.018,0.912,0.07,0.9477

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States has approved a possible $100 million sale of equipment and services to Taiwan to ""sustain, maintain, and improve"" its Patriot missile defense system, the Pentagon said on Monday, drawing an angry threat of retaliation from Beijing.

China, which claims self-governed Taiwan as its own, routinely objects to U.S. arms sales, adding to existing Sino-U.S. tensions.

A statement from the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said it had delivered the required certification notifying Congress following State Department approval for the sale, which was requested by Taiwan's de facto embassy in Washington.

Upgrades to the Patriot Air Defense System would ""help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, economic and progress in the region,"" the DSCA said in a statement.

""This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,"" the agency said.

The main contractors would be Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ), it said.

Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said it ""highly welcomed"" the decision.

""In the face of China's continued military expansion and provocative actions, our country will maintain its national security with a solid defense, and continue to deepen the close security partnership between Taiwan and the United States,"" it said in a statement.

In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian offered strong condemnation.

""China will take appropriate and forceful measures to firmly safeguard its sovereignty and security interests,"" he told reporters.

Asked what measures China would take, Zhao said: ""I wish to ask everyone to wait and see"".

China has imposed https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-taiwan-idUSKBN27B0P0 sanctions on Lockheed Martin and other U.S. companies in the past for selling weapons to Taiwan, though it is unclear what form the penalties have taken.

Taiwan's Defense Ministry has said the decision to obtain newer Patriot missiles was made during a 2019 meeting with U.S. officials in the administration of President Donald Trump.

The ministry said the deal was expected to ""come into effect"" within one month.

The democratically governed island has complained of repeated missions by China's air force in its air defense zone, part of what Washington sees as Beijing's effort to pressure Taipei into accepting its sovereignty.

The United States, like most countries, does not have official relations with Taiwan, but Washington is its biggest backer and is bound by law to provide it with means to defend itself.

U.S. officials have been pushing Taiwan to modernize its military so it can become a ""porcupine,"" hard for China to attack.

China's ambassador to the United States said last month that the two super powers could end up in a military conflict if Washington encourages Taiwan's independence.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/us-approves-100-million-sale-for-taiwan-missile-upgrades-2758955,0.047,0.832,0.121,0.9765

(Reuters) - U.S. arms maker Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) called off plans on Sunday to acquire rocket engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE: ) Inc for $4.4 billion amid opposition from U.S. antitrust enforcers.

The Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal in late-January on the grounds that it would allow Lockheed to use its control of Aerojet to hurt other defense contractors. Missile maker Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) was an outspoken opponent of the proposed acquisition.

The merger, which was announced in late 2020, drew criticism as it would give Lockheed a dominant position over solid fuel rocket motors -- a vital piece of the U.S. missile industry.

Lockheed's Chief Executive James Taiclet said the acquisition would have improved efficiency, speed and cut costs for the U.S. government, but that terminating the agreement was in its stakeholders' best interest.

Aerojet, which reports fourth quarter earnings later this week, said in a separate statement that it still expects a strong ""future performance,"" despite the scrapped merger.

The companies' merger agreement does not include a termination fee in the event that antitrust regulators opposed the deal, according to a regulatory filing. A Lockheed spokesman previously said the company did not plan to make any such payment to Aerojet.

If the deal had ended up in court, it would have been the first litigated defense merger challenge in decades, according to FTC.

Other critics of the deal included U.S. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who https://reut.rs/3GMsoOshad asked the FTC to examine the internal firewalls Lockheed said it would put in place to prevent it from gaining a competitive advantage over its peers.

Lockheed had said it accounted for 33% of Aerojet's sales and argued that the deal would reduce costs for the Pentagon and the U.S. taxpayer.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China is concerned about the ""worsening"" situation in Ukraine, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday, repeating his call for all parties to show restraint and resolve differences through dialogue.

Accelerating a crisis the West fears could spark a war, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered on Monday the deployment of troops to two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine after recognising them as independent.

Russia denies any plan to attack Ukraine, but has threatened unspecified ""military-technical"" action unless it receives sweeping security guarantees, including a promise that its neighbour will never join NATO.

The legitimate security concerns of any country should be respected, Wang, who is also a Chinese state councillor, told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a telephone call, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement.

""The situation in Ukraine is worsening,"" Wang told Blinken. ""China once again calls on all parties to exercise restraint.""

On the call, Blinken underscored the need to preserve Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity amid Russia's

""aggression"", said Ned Price, a U.S. State Department spokesperson.

Earlier on Tuesday, China's embassy in Ukraine warned its nationals there not to venture into unstable areas, but stopped short of telling them to leave, as many other nations have advised their own citizens. [L1N2UX0EH]

""The Chinese embassy in Ukraine has issued a reminder to Chinese citizens and enterprises to strengthen security precautions,"" said Wang Wenbin, a foreign ministry spokesman.

The embassy will ensure that dietary needs of Chinese citizens in Ukraine are met in a timely way, Wang said at a regular media briefing in response to a query about when China would pull out its citizens.

China is closely following the evolving situation in Ukraine, Wang told the briefing, which drew more reporters than usual.

TAIWAN, NORTH KOREA

The United States should not include Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, in America's Indo-Pacific strategy, Wang told Blinken.

This month, the United States said it would commit more diplomatic and security resources to the Indo-Pacific, and vowed to work with partners both in and outside the region to maintain peace and stability in the strait dividing Taiwan from China.

The attempt to include Taiwan in the strategy to contain China is sending all the ""wrong signals"", Wang told Blinken on the telephone call, the foreign ministry said in its statement.

Still, China is willing to manage its differences with the United States and stabilise two-way ties, Wang added.

On Monday, China said it had placed Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp under sanctions over arms sales to Taiwan, in at least the third time it has announced punishments for the U.S. firms.

Taiwan's foreign ministry said it would continue to urge the United States to keep selling the island weapons ""in the face of China's military threats and intimidation"".

""The U.S. provision to us of defensive weapons helps defend Taiwan's democracy and freedom, as well as ensures national security and peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region,"" spokesperson Joanne Ou told reporters on Tuesday.

Blinken and Wang also spoke on developments in North Korea.

China calls for direct dialogue between the United States and North Korea, and will, as always, seek to play a constructive role in promoting resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, Wang said.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/china-warns-us-against-including-taiwan-in-its-indopacific-plan-2768791,0.068,0.798,0.134,0.9933

MILAN (Reuters) - European defence stocks were among the rare gainers in a falling market on Thursday on bets of bigger spending after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in the biggest attack in Europe since World War Two.

Shares in Britain's biggest defence company BAE Systems (OTC: ) rose 4.8% to a one-year high and Germany's Rheinmetall gained more than 2%. France's Thales added 1% in late morning trading.

Shares in major U.S. defense contractors gained in premarket trading, with Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ), Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE: ) rallying between 3% and 6%.

Investors expect defence companies to benefit from rising geopolitical tensions, with European and U.S. defence contractors well positioned, especially if NATO member states boost spending.

""Invasion will likely result in NATO military involvement, initially benefiting short cycle product spending (weapons and ammunitions) and putting significant upward pressure on NATO defence budgets over the medium term,"" said Law Ross, analyst at Berenberg in London.

Rheinmetall and BAE have the largest exposure to weapons and ammunition, while UK contractor Chemring along with BAE are most exposed to cyber security and electronic warfare, according to the German investment banks. Chemring rose 1%.

BAE said on Thursday that Russia's invasion of Ukraine would place a sharper focus on security, anticipating growth over the coming years across all sectors, with cyber intelligence also becoming globally relevant.

Traders also highlighted that the industry's stock market valuations remain cheap, which could make it attractive for investors seeking to diversify away from pricey tech stocks.

The European defence sector, which has been hit by ESG concerns and worries over budget cuts, trades at around a 20% discount to the market, according to Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) estimates.

Among other companies with defence exposure, shares in Ultra Electronics were little changed, while QinetiQ and Meggitt (LON: ) fell slightly but still outperformed the steep market falls. European shares fell almost 4%.

The majority of NATO members including Germany spends in defence less than the targeted 2% of GDP. If all countries were to reach the target that would result in 73 billion euros in incremental defence spending, per Berenberg.

In an unusual public rant a few hours after Russia invaded Ukraine, the chief of the German army vented his frustration over what he saw as the long-running neglect of military readiness in his country.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/european-defence-stocks-rise-as-russia-invades-ukraine-2771186,0.059,0.852,0.089,0.2152

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -A number of big investors on Monday filed to end their lawsuits against Allianz (DE: ) after a settlement was reached over their losses in a multibillion-dollar trading debacle at the German asset manager's funds arm.

The move marks an important milestone in the downfall of the $15 billion Structured Alpha funds, a saga that has dogged the German insurer and asset manager for two years.

But it isn't over yet. Allianz is still bracing for the outcome of U.S. regulatory investigations by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Allianz said earlier this month that it had settled with a number of investors, but didn't provide details about who. At the time, it said that it set aside 3.7 billion euros ($4.15 billion) to deal with the lawsuits and investigations.

The sum pushed Allianz into a fourth-quarter loss and resulted in a cut in pay for its chief executive and other board members.

Monday's filings in a New York court were from pension funds for various Blue Cross and Blue Shield entities and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp.

The filings and Sean Gallagher, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs with the firm Bartlit Beck, didn't disclose financial details.

""We are happy to say that we reached a settlement with Allianz, which is good for our clients,"" he said.

The Allianz funds used complex options strategies to generate returns but when the coronavirus pandemic sent stock markets into a tailspin in February and March 2020, they plummeted in value, in some cases by 80% or more.

Investors in the funds, which were predominantly U.S. public pension funds, then sued Allianz for a total of $6 billion in damages.

In their lawsuits, investors alleged Allianz had strayed from its stated investment strategy of hedging to limit potential losses.

Other pension funds that invested in the funds included those for labourers in Alaska, teachers in Arkansas and subway workers in New York.

Allianz declined to comment.

(Reuters) - The ended lower after a volatile session on Monday, with investors wrestling with uncertainty and bank stocks dropping following powerful Western sanctions against Russia as it continued its invasion of Ukraine.

Helping the Nasdaq close in positive territory after opening at a loss, electric car makers Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Rivian Automotive jumped 7.5% and 6.5%, respectively.

Citigroup (NYSE: ) fell 4.5% and helped push the S&P 500 banks index down 2.35% as the slipped. The broader S&P 500 financial index dropped 1.5%.

Global stocks slumped, the Russian rouble tanked to record lows and safe-haven assets got a boost after Western allies imposed new sanctions that limited Moscow's ability to deploy its $630 billion foreign reserves and cut off some of its banks from the SWIFT global payments system.

Russian artillery bombarded residential districts of Ukraine's second-largest city, as Moscow's invading forces met stiff resistance on a fifth day of conflict.

""The Russia-Ukraine invasion in itself is not likely going to be a long-term headwind for U.S. equities. But I think in the short term, it's a massive contributor to the equity pullback,"" said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs.

The worsening geopolitical crisis has added to investors' concerns about soaring inflation and the Federal Reserve's rate-hike plans. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq logged their biggest two-month declines since the pandemic-led crash in March 2020.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Thursday on disappointment at the failure of ceasefire talks between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers.

Negotiations between Sergey Lavrov and Dmytro Kuleba in Turkey, the highest-level contact between the two countries since Russia invaded two weeks ago, with no visible progress.

The downbeat mood was reinforced later by U.S. consumer inflation data for February, which showed prices rising at their fastest in over 40 years, cementing expectations of a first interest rate hike in two weeks' time from the Federal Reserve.

By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the was down 325 points, or 1.0%, while the was down by a similar amount and the was down by 1.4%. The three indices had gained between 2% and 3.6% on Wednesday in anticipation of the talks.

The accelerated to 7.9% in February, in line with expectations but the highest since January 1982. also rose to a 40-year high of 6.4% as the extraordinary amount of liquidity created by the Fed during the pandemic seeped into an ever-broader cross-section of prices.

""The Russia-Ukraine war adds further fuel to the blazing rate of inflation via higher energy, food, and core commodity prices that are turbo charged by a worsening in supply chain problems,"" said Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics in a note to clients. ""This will lead to a higher near-term peak in inflation and a slower descent through 2022 than previously envisaged.""

Bostjancic expects inflation to average 6.5% this year, leading the Fed to raise rates by 175 basis points.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) stock bucked the negative trend in early dealings, rising 4.8% thanks to the announcement late on Wednesday of a new $10 billion buyback program and a 20-for-1 stock split that's aimed at making the stock more easily accessible to smaller investors. It had been down some 15% for the year as of Wednesday's close.

Amazon's e-commerce peers in China fell under a harsher spotlight, as JD.com reported its slowest sales growth in six quarters, along with an operating loss due to higher input costs. JD.com (NASDAQ: ) ADRs fell 14%, dragging rival Pinduoduo (NASDAQ: ) down by a similar amount. Chinese online realtor Ke Holdings (NYSE: ) fell an even bigger 16% after reporting a stubbornly wide net loss and a worsening operating margin in the fourth quarter.

Elsewhere, business software group Asana (NYSE: ) fell 24% after it forecast revenue growth would slow to 40% this year from 67% last year, when the pandemic and the spread of remote work had created more favorable conditions for it. The opposite was true for Crowdstrike (NASDAQ: ) stock, which rose 13% after the company posted strong quarterly numbers and predicted another good year ahead.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Many Democrats thought their control of the White House and Congress would provide an opportunity to rein in U.S. military spending, which had leaped 140% since 2000, and to beef up social programs they felt had been neglected.

Then Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, bringing intense pressure to boost the Pentagon's budget significantly, and not just for the coming year.

""The world did not cooperate,"" said Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.

Congress this month passed an increase in defense spending of nearly 6%, a total expected to keep rising despite President Joe Biden's withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan in August after 20 years of war. Kaine said Russia and China were both concerns.

""The switch of the primary threat from non-state terrorist organizations to nation-states - and two big ones - that's going to require significant investment, and some retooling of investment,"" Kaine told Reuters.

Defense cuts have always been a tough sell in Congress. Support for a powerful military is a traditional area of bipartisan agreement, while defense contractors exert strong influence as a leading-edge industry, major employers and campaign donors.

In his first year in office, Biden submitted a budget keeping Department of Defense spending basically flat. Congress backed an increase even before Russian President Vladimir Putin's government invaded neighboring Ukraine last month.

Representative Adam Smith, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, had hoped to tamp down what he saw as a bloated Pentagon budget. But he said in a speech at the American Enterprise Institute this month that had changed.

""The Russian invasion of Ukraine fundamentally altered what our national security posture and what our defense posture needs to be. It made it more complicated, and it made it more expensive,"" he said.

Analysts, lawmakers and congressional aides said higher spending would likely continue even after the most urgent fears about Russian ambitions wear off.

""Never waste a crisis,"" said Valerie Shen, director of the National Security program at Third Way, a center-left think tank in Washington. ""Use it as an argument to get the policy position you always wanted anyway,"" she said.

'PERMANENT INCREASE'

NATO allies like Germany have increased their military spending in the past month. Washington is expected to keep spending more, to support any ongoing Ukrainian resistance and back up allies most exposed to Russian threats.

""I could see the United States increasing its presence in Europe. It could be a permanent increase in defense posture"" or temporary deployments, said Todd Harrison, a defense budget analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Biden is expected to announce his fiscal 2023 budget request on March 28.

Harrison speculated that Congress - which controls federal spending - could add $20 billion to $30 billion to whatever the Democratic president requests.

The 2023 total U.S. national defense budget will top $800 billion, giving U.S. arms makers a revenue tailwind after the COVID-19 pandemic choked supply chains for aerospace and microchips and hampered sales.

Senator Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said it was too early to know the overall dollar amount Congress might settle upon for the military, especially given the fluid situation in Ukraine.

""We should never turn our back on people fighting for freedom,"" he told Reuters in a hallway interview.

The Dow Jones U.S. Defense Index, which tracks shares of defense contractors, is up nearly 14% since Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded Ukraine, an action Moscow calls a ""special operation.""

The largest U.S.-based defense contractors are Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ), Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), Boeing (NYSE: ) Co, Northrup Grumman and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE: )..

For the last year, progressive Democrats had been pressuring party leaders to push for more spending on non-defense priorities such as battling climate change; helping lower-income families with childcare; and expanding healthcare for the elderly.

Lawmakers who want to tamp down military spending increases said they would not stop trying, although they were not optimistic.

Democratic Representative Jim McGovern, chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee and a member of the Progressive Caucus, said he supported Ukraine but not an endlessly expanding military budget.

""I would encourage us to take a more critical look at Pentagon spending in general. I think that's separate and apart from what's happening there (Ukraine),"" he said as he left a speech to Congress last week by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose appeal for more help left some lawmakers in tears.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysisukraine-crisis-could-derail-drive-to-limit-us-defense-spending-2790068,0.055,0.813,0.131,0.994

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's record peacetime national defense budget request of $813 billion boasts a 4.6% pay raise for troops and the largest research and development budget in history, as Russian aggression in Ukraine spurs demands for more military spending.

Biden's request earmarks $773 billion for the Pentagon, and eclipses the budget requests by former President Donald Trump. An additional $40 billion is earmarked for defense-related programs at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Energy and other agencies, bringing the national security budget to $813 billion, up from $778 billion last year.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has driven recent support for greater defense spending among Democrats and Republicans who see a growing national security and foreign policy threat from Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The budget increases funds for the Pentagon's European Deterrence Initiative by $360 million to a total of $4.2 billion.

At the same time, the budget slows the Department of Defense's purchasing of the stealthy F-35 fighter jet, the Pentagon's largest weapons program, after Air Force leaders complained that technological improvements to the jet's hardware were too slow.

Budget talks between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the White House coalesced around the $773 billion early on, defense officials said. Reuters first reported the figure in February.

Among the top priorities for this budget are shipbuilding, developing capabilities in space, missile warning and modernizing the nuclear ""triad"" of ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land-based missiles.

Only 61 F-35 jets made by Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) were requested by the Pentagon, down from a request of 85 last year, though experts believe Congress will increase that figure during the budget process.

The budget would benefit the biggest U.S. defense contractors including Lockheed, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE: ) and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE: ).

The 2023 fiscal budget, which starts on Oct. 1, boasts the Pentagon's largest research and development budget ever, with $130 billion earmarked to develop new weaponry like hypersonic missiles to fight any potential future wars against China and Russia.

Some of that investment is funded by retiring equipment like Littoral Combat Ships that are expensive to operate, and older planes like A-10 Warthogs, which the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan last year has made less essential because they are vulnerable to more sophisticated enemies.

The national defense budget request crafted during Trump's final year in office was for $752.9 billion. Congress then increased that amount by $25 billion, ultimately landing at $778 billion for fiscal 2022.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/biden-wants-813-billion-for-defense-as-ukraine-crisis-raises-alarm-2793280,0.064,0.832,0.104,0.9276

(Reuters) - One of Russia's flagship airliner projects, the Irkut MS-21, will use domestic engines given that sanctions mean U.S. models are no longer available, the RIA news agency cited a senior official as saying on Thursday.

The medium-range plane, also known as the MC-21, can carry more than 200 passengers and is due to enter service this year. First designed with engines from Pratt and Whitney, a unit of Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), in December 2020 the plane flew for the first time with Russian-built turbofans.

RIA cited deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov as saying the plane would now only use PD-14 engines produced by the United Engine Corporation (UEC), which he said would need to expand its facilities to boost output.

The plane is built by Irkut Corporation, part of United Aircraft Corporation, which like the UEC is majority owned by Rostec, Russia's state aerospace and defence conglomerate.",https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/new-russian-airliner-will-use-domestic-engines-given-sanctions--official-2795921,0.013,0.897,0.091,0.8934

Investing.com – Stocks of Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) were trading higher Tuesday after Australia picked the two defense contractors to build and supply missiles to it to counter China.

According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the two companies will partner a new government-backed firm to domestically build guided weapons for the military. The country currently sources its missiles from the U.S. and other countries.

Australia plans to accelerate the deployment of new long-range missiles.

The report quoted the country’s Defense Minister Peter Dutton as saying that missiles made in the country could also be exported to the U.S.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the threat from China has prompted several countries to have a re-look at their defense preparedness and forced them to commit much more than they ever did.

Australia has committed to expand the size of its standing military by 30% and build a new submarine base on its east coast that would be able to host visiting U.S. vessels. The country is now a part of two alliances – the Quad and the AUKUS. QUAD includes the U.S., India and Japan while the three-member AUKUS also comprises the U.S. and the U.K.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lockheed-raytheon-gain-on-australia-order-to-build-missiles-2798281,0.041,0.91,0.049,-0.296

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine on Wednesday, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery ahead of a wider Russian assault expected in eastern Ukraine.

The package, which brings the total military aid since Russian forces invaded in February to more than $2.5 billion, includes artillery systems, artillery rounds, armored personnel carriers and unmanned coastal defense boats, Biden said in a statement after a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

Biden said he had also approved the transfer of additional helicopters, saying equipment provided to Ukraine ""has been critical"" as it confronts the invasion.

""We cannot rest now. As I assured President Zelenskyy, the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom,"" Biden said in a written statement.

The new package includes 11 Mi-17 helicopters that had been earmarked for Afghanistan before the U.S.-backed government collapsed last year. It also includes 18 155mm howitzers, along with 40,000 artillery rounds, counter-artillery radars, 200 armored personnel carriers and 300 additional ""Switchblade"" drones.

This was the first time howitzers have been provided to Ukraine by the United States.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE: ) said some of the systems, like the howitzers and radars, will require additional training for Ukrainian forces not accustomed to using American military equipment.

""We're aware of the clock and we know time is not our friend,"" Kirby said when asked about the speed of deliveries.

'BIGGER, MORE POWERFUL WEAPONS'

The new aid - first reported by Reuters on Tuesday - will be funded using Presidential Drawdown Authority, or PDA, in which the president can authorize the transfer of articles and services from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency.

John Spencer, a retired U.S. Army major and expert on urban warfare at the Madison Policy Forum, said he was excited to see that the United States was sending artillery and artillery rounds.

""You need these bigger, more powerful weapons ... to match what Russia is bringing to try to take eastern Ukraine,"" Spencer said.

As news of the latest security assistance came out, executives from the top U.S. weapons makers met with Pentagon officials to discuss the industrial challenges in the event of a protracted Ukraine conflict.

These included executives from BAE Systems (OTC: ) Plc, General Dynamics Corp (NYSE: ), Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ), Huntington Ingalls (NYSE: ) Industries, L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: ), Boeing (NYSE: ) Co, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp and Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE: ).

In a statement, Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon said the discussion ""focused primarily on accelerating production and building more capacity across the industrial base for weapons and equipment that can be exported rapidly, deployed with minimal training, and prove effective in the battlefield.""

Zelenskiy has been pleading with U.S. and European leaders to provide heavier arms and equipment. Thousands have been killed and millions displaced in the seven-week-long invasion.

Russia has been unable to achieve most of its military goals as Ukrainians have put up a fiercer-than-expected resistance.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and capture what it views as dangerous nationalists, but Ukraine and the West say Russia began an unprovoked war of aggression.

On Wednesday, Russia said it had taken control of the southeastern Ukrainian port of Mariupol and that more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines had surrendered.",https://www.investing.com/news/general/us-announces-additional-800-million-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-2803453,0.061,0.891,0.048,-0.9076

ROME (Reuters) - European missile maker MBDA has made a good start to 2022 after record results last year, Executive Group Director for Sales & Business Development Lorenzo Mariani said on Friday.

""It's great news, both in terms of orders and in terms of cash,"" Mariani told reporters.

He added that important contracts been closed in the first months of the year and others, signed with Greece at the end of 2021, had taken effect.

""These (deals) have given us important advance payments"".

The missile group is owned by France's Airbus and Britain's BAE Systems (OTC: ), both with a 37.5% stake, and by Italy's Leonardo, with a 25% stake.

Mariani said that the group has not suffered any disruption to production from the conflict in Ukraine, but noted that should the war continue there could be consequences from the increases in energy costs and the price and availability of raw materials.

""We have always had good supplies, to date there are no critical issues, but the situation would not be sustainable forever,"" he said.

MBDA is unable to comment on the impact of the conflict on demand, citing confidentiality linked to military operations.

The consortium posted 4.2 billion euros ($4.54 billion) in revenue last year and new orders were worth 5.12 billion euros.

MBDA has some 16% of the global missile market, in terms of orders, but is the largest player in Europe, with a 43% share, a company slide showed.

Its largest rivals are U.S. defence giant Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp

Mariani, who is also the Managing Director of MBDA in Italy, said the first quarter in the country ""confirmed a positive trend, with revenues and cash above expectations, and deliveries ahead of schedule"".

MONTREAL (Reuters) -Air Canada on Tuesday said it is adding capacity to meet a rebound in spring traffic and sees ticket sales and business travel improving after reporting a larger-than-expected quarterly loss, sending shares down more than 5%.

Carriers are benefiting from a broader revival in travel demand as COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions ease, but face pressures from higher fuel costs.

Chief Executive Michael Rousseau said the Canadian government is reviewing the use of mask and vaccine mandates for airline travel.

Canada's largest carrier is increasing second quarter available seat mile (ASM) capacity by approximately 414% compared with the same three months in 2021.

""This summer, we will be at nearly 80% of 2019, and we're targeting to be close to full recovery during 2024,"" Air Canada Chief Commercial Officer Lucie Guillemette told analysts.

Guillemette expects positive yields compared with 2019 for corporate travel. Business travel, now 50% below 2019, is expected to improve to 40% below that level by June.

When asked about the possibility of relaxing mask mandates, Transport Minister Omar Alghabra told reporters in Ottawa to ""stay tuned"" and ""we're reassessing every policy that we have.""

But Canadian Minister of Health Jean-Yves Duclos also said on Tuesday he thinks ""we expect Canadians to keep wearing a mask when they travel by air.""

Canada is seeing higher travel demand ahead of the busy summer season and attracted more than one million travelers during the week of April 11 for the first time since the pandemic.

Rousseau said passenger ticket sales last month were more than 90% of March 2019 levels, ""a leading indicator to much stronger 2022 second- and third-quarter results.""

Air Canada reported quarterly revenues more than doubled from a year ago C$2.57 billion ($2.01 billion) but also reported a loss of C$2.72 per diluted share versus a loss of C$3.90 per diluted share during the same period in 2021.

Analysts were expecting a loss of C$1.49 a share, according to estimates from Refinitiv.

Air Canada shares were trading at C$22.88.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will travel to Alabama on Tuesday to visit a Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) facility that is manufacturing weapons being provided to Ukraine, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, the White House said on Wednesday.

Washington says it has pledged around $3.7 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24. Together with its European allies, Washington has provided Ukraine with drones, Howitzer heavy artillery, anti-aircraft Stinger and Javelin missiles.

Lockheed Martin, the No. 1 U.S. weapons maker, said the Ukraine war has boosted demand for missile defense systems. The company developed and produces the Javelin anti-tank missiles together with U.S. weapons maker Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ).

(Reuters) -Honeywell International Inc raised its full-year profit forecast on Friday, as a recovery in aviation markets due to a pickup in travel boosted demand for the company's parts, software and aftermarket services, sending its shares up as much as 6%.

Booming air travel demand has prompted legacy aircraft makers such as Boeing (NYSE: ) Co and Airbus SE (OTC: ) to increase production, leading to higher orders for parts makers such as Honeywell (NASDAQ: ).

""Our end market setup continues to be strong with ongoing improvement in global flight hours, return to public spaces and elevated oil prices,"" Chief Financial Officer Gregory Lewis said during an analyst call.

The company, which builds everything from aircraft engines to cockpit components, said it expects 2022 adjusted profit per share of $8.50 to $8.80, higher than its previous forecast range of $8.40 to $8.70.

Honeywell's results were also helped by higher sales in the segment that makes fire sensors and security cameras for buildings as more people returned to working from office.

""We think underlying demand momentum in Honeywell's end markets continues to build, supporting relatively good visibility despite what remains a challenging operating environment,"" Citi Research analyst Andrew Kaplowitz said in a research note.

Honeywell also raised the lower end of its full-year sales guidance to $35.5 billion to $36.4 billion from its previous range of $35.4 billion to $36.4 billion, in contrast to its peer Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) which cut its outlook on Tuesday.

Honeywell's first-quarter adjusted net income per share of $1.91 beat analyst expectations of $1.86 per share, according to Refinitiv data, on higher prices.

Sales in the North Carolina-based company's high-margin aerospace unit rose 4.4% to $2.75 billion.

Honeywell said it also recorded a $183 million charge and lost sales of about $30 million in the quarter through March as the company ""substantially"" suspended Russia operations.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/honeywell-raises-fullyear-profit-forecast-betting-on-air-travel-recovery-2813931,0.046,0.868,0.086,0.9506

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's Defence Ministry on Tuesday said deliveries of shoulder-fired Stinger anti-aircraft missiles could be delayed, saying they were pressing the United States to deliver on schedule as the war in Ukraine pressures supplies.

The missiles are in hot demand in Ukraine, where they have successfully kept Russian aircraft at bay, but U.S. supplies have shrunk and producing more of the anti-aircraft weapons faces significant hurdles.

The United States approved the sale of 250 of Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: )' Stinger missiles to Taiwan in 2019. Taiwanese media has reported Taiwan expected to complete delivery by 2026.

Chu Wen-wu, deputy head of Taiwan's army planning department, said those deliveries may get held up.

""It is true that due to changes in the international situation, there may be a risk of delayed delivery this year of the portable Stinger missiles,"" he told a news conference. ""The Army will coordinate with the full procurement plan and continue to require the U.S. military to implement it normally in accordance with the contract.""

Ministry spokesman Sun Li-fang added that procurement of General Dynamics Corp (NYSE: ) M1A2 Abrams tanks was ""normal"" - Taiwan plans to buy 108 of them with delivery by 2027.

Taiwan's air force is also in touch with the United States to ensure that deliveries of new F-16 fighter jets take place on schedule before 2026, he said.

This is the second time this week the ministry has warned of delayed deliveries of U.S. weapons.

It said on Monday it was considering alternative weapons options after the United States informed it that the delivery of an artillery system would be delayed due to a ""crowded"" production line.

Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, is undertaking a military modernisation programme to improve its capabilities to fend off a Chinese attack, including with precision weapons like missiles.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan signalled on Thursday that it had abandoned a plan to buy advanced new anti-submarine warfare helicopters from the United States, saying they were too expensive.

Taiwan had earlier said it was planning to buy 12 MH-60R anti-submarine helicopters, made by Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) unit Sikorsky, but domestic media said the United States had rejected the sale as not being in line with the island's needs.

Asked in parliament about recent changes to Taiwan's purchases of new U.S. weapons, Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng mentioned the helicopter case first.

""The price is too high, beyond the scope of our country's ability,"" he said.

Two other arms purchases have also been delayed - M109A6 Medium Self-Propelled Howitzer artillery systems, and mobile Stinger anti-aircraft missiles.

The Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: )' Stingers are in hot demand in Ukraine, where they have been used against Russian aircraft, but U.S. supplies have shrunk and there are significant hurdles to producing more of the anti-aircraft weapons.

Chiu said they had already signed the contract for the Stingers and paid for them, and they would press the United States to deliver them.

""We don't view arms sales as a trifling matter, and we have back-up plans,"" he added, without elaborating.

Taiwan says the United States has offered it alternatives to the M109A6, including truck-based rocket launchers made by Lockheed Martin called the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS.

Chiu said they were still considering their options on that.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson declined to comment on specific platforms but said: ""The United States' swift provision to Taiwan of defensive weaponry ... is essential for Taiwan's security, and we will continue to work with industry to support that goal.""

Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, is undertaking a military modernisation programme to improve its capabilities to fend off a Chinese attack, including with precision weapons like missiles.

President Tsai Ing-wen has championed the concept of ""asymmetric warfare"", which involves developing high-tech, highly mobile weapons that are hard to destroy and can deliver precision attacks.

U.S. officials have been pushing Taiwan to modernise its military so it can become a ""porcupine"" that is hard for China to attack.

China has been ramping up its own military modernisation and pressure against Taiwan as it seeks to force the democratically governed island to accept Beijing's rule.

Chiu said that recently - without giving a timeframe - there were many ""enemy ships"" in the waters around Taiwan, which ""in principle stand off"" with Taiwanese forces. He did not give details.

(Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) has been awarded two contracts worth $309 million by the U.S. army for its Javelin missiles, the antitank weapon that has helped Ukraine fight Russia's invasion, the company said on Monday.

The Javelin missiles are made jointly by Lockheed and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: )' missile unit.

Demand for Javelin missiles remains high as the war in Ukraine worsens, where they were used to stop Russian tanks from advancing on the capital, to an artillery battle in Ukraine's east.

So far, the United States has sent more then 5,500 Javelin systems to Ukraine.

(Reuters) - A joint venture between Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp has been awarded two contracts worth $309 million by the U.S. army for its Javelin missiles, the antitank weapon that has helped Ukraine fight Russia's invasion, Lockheed said on Monday.

The Javelin missiles are made jointly by Lockheed and Raytheon (NYSE: )'s missile unit.

Demand for Javelin missiles remains high as the war in Ukraine worsens, where they were used to stop Russian tanks from advancing on the capital, to an artillery battle in Ukraine's east.

So far, the United States has sent more then 5,500 Javelin systems to Ukraine.

The defense contractor added that the contracts include more than 1,300 Javelin missiles funded from the recent Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act and orders for several international customers including Norway, Albania, Latvia and Thailand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House is working to put advanced anti-ship missiles in the hands of Ukrainian fighters to help defeat Russia's naval blockade, officials said, amid concerns more powerful weapons that could sink Russian warships would intensify the conflict.

Ukraine has made no secret it wants more advanced U.S. capabilities beyond its current inventory of artillery, Javelin and Stinger missiles, and other arms. Kyiv's list, for example, includes missiles that could push the Russian navy away from its Black Sea ports, allowing the restart of shipments of grain and other agricultural products worldwide.

Current and former U.S. officials and congressional sources have cited roadblocks to sending longer range, more powerful weapons to Ukraine that include lengthy training requirements, difficulties maintaining equipment, or concerns U.S. weaponry could be captured by Russian forces, in addition to the fear of escalation.

But three U.S. officials and two congressional sources said two types of powerful anti-ship missiles, the Harpoon made by Boeing (NYSE: ) and the Naval Strike Missile made by Kongsberg and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) were in active consideration for either direct shipment to Ukraine, or through a transfer from a European ally that has the missiles.

In April, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to Portugal to provide the Ukrainian military with Harpoons, which have a range of up to almost 300 km.

But there are several issues keeping Ukraine from receiving the missiles. For one, there is limited availability of platforms to launch Harpoons from shore -- a technically challenging solution according to several officials -- as it is mostly a sea-based missile.

Two U.S. officials said the United States was working on potential solutions that included pulling a launcher off of a U.S. ship. Both missiles cost about $1.5 million per round, according to experts and industry executives.

About 20 Russian Navy vessels, including submarines, are in the Black Sea operational zone, the British defense ministry has said.

Bryan Clark, a naval expert at the Hudson (NYSE: ) Institute, said 12 to 24 anti-ship missiles like the Harpoon with ranges over 100 km would be enough to threaten Russian ships and could convince Moscow to lift the blockade. ""If Putin persists, Ukraine could take out the largest Russian ships, since they have nowhere to hide in the Black Sea,"" Clark said.

Russia has already suffered losses at sea, notably the sinking of the cruiser Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea fleet.

WHO GOES FIRST?

A handful of countries would be willing to send Harpoons to Ukraine, the U.S. officials and the congressional sources said. But no one wants to be the first or only nation to do so, fearing reprisals from Russia if a ship is sunk with a Harpoon from their stockpile, the third U.S official said.

That U.S. official said one country is considering being the first to supply the missile to Ukraine. Once that ""well stocked"" nation commits to sending Harpoons, others might follow, the official said.

The Naval Strike Missile (NSM) can be launched from the Ukrainian coast and has a range of 250 km. It also takes less than 14 days training to operate.

The sources said NSMs were viewed as less logistically difficult than Harpoons, because NATO allies could loan mobile ground launchers which are available, and warheads from Norway.

The first two U.S. officials and the congressional sources said the United States was trying to work out a way for Ukraine to obtain NSM and launchers from European allies.

The congressional sources said another option would be for Norway to donate NSMs to Ukraine, an idea supported by Norwegian members of parliament https://mil.in.ua/en/news/norwegian-parliament-is-proposing-to-transfer-the-nasams-air-defense-and-nsm-strike-missiles-to-ukraine. The Norwegian Ministry of Defense declined to comment on what additional contributions of arms and defense equipment it may consider offering to Ukraine.

All weapons requests that have U.S. content such as Harpoons and NSMs would have to be approved by the U.S. State Department, which takes guidance from the White House.

Another weapon high on Ukraine's shopping list are Multiple Rocket Launch Systems (MLRS) such as the M270 made by Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) which can strike a target 70 or more kilometers away, a three-fold increase over many of their current howitzer rounds.

In recent weeks, the Biden administration decided instead to send M777 towed howitzers which could be deployed faster and shipped in larger quantities, the two U.S. officials said.

The two U.S. officials said the M270 or similar system like the M142 HIMARS would be considered for shipment to Ukraine once Congress passed a $40 billion supplemental funding bill that would authorize an additional $11 billion worth of Presidential Drawdown Authority. That lets the president authorize the transfer of excess weapons from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/exclusiveus-aims-to-arm-ukraine-with-advanced-antiship-missiles-to-fight-russian-blockade-2828166,0.074,0.853,0.073,-0.5543

(Reuters) -Jet engine maker CFM International is facing industrial delays of six to eight weeks in the wake of supply-chain problems and some French labour unrest, but expects to claw most of this back by early in the fourth quarter, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Co-owned by General Electric (NYSE: ) Co and France's Safran (EPA: ), CFM is the largest jet engine maker by units sold, and powers three out of four narrowbody jets including all Boeing (NYSE: ) 737 MAX and about half of Airbus' A320neo.

Some Airbus customers have been warned deliveries of aircraft, already partially delayed by European factory congestion, could be pushed back further as a result of the CFM engine delays, said the people, who asked not to be named.

Two of the people said there had also been delays in sending engines to Boeing though there were no immediate signs that this was affecting airplane deliveries. Boeing is building at a slower rate as it clears jets stored during a safety crisis.

""We are working diligently with our suppliers to mitigate supply-chain constraints, and we are closely coordinating with our air frame partners to accelerate delivery and meet customer demand,"" a CFM spokesperson said in answer to a Reuters query.

An Airbus spokesman said it had nothing to add to recent supply-chain comments given with its quarterly results.

Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury told analysts on May 4 that he saw ""a lot of challenges"" in the supply chain in the short term, but felt comfortable enough on the medium- to long-term outlook to press ahead with planned output increases.

A Boeing spokesperson declined comment.

Shares in Airbus fell around 2% and Safran fell 3% in early trading on Tuesday.

Jefferies analyst Chloe Lemarie said supply disruptions had already been much discussed during the recent quarterly results season but 6-8-week delays ""may be challenging"" to recoup fully.

Airbus is likely to keep its forecast for 720 deliveries in 2022 but ""there is likely only a very slim buffer"" she said in a note to investors.

LABOUR TENSIONS

Two of the people said the CFM delays were mainly linked to supplier bottlenecks, but had been aggravated by recent industrial action in France. A third source said the recent Safran labour dispute was not the decisive factor, however.

Aerospace workers at Safran, a major supplier of other equipment including interiors and landing gear as well as the French pillar of the transatlantic CFM venture with GE, have held slowdowns or lightning stoppages over pay in recent months.

The French group awarded staff a 3% increase late last year as the industry began emerging from the COVID-19 crisis but unions say this is not enough to counter a spike in inflation. Safran has on average agreed to add a further 1%, they add.

CFM is not alone in wrestling with fractured supply chains. Aerospace companies worldwide have been counting the cost of supply-chain shortages. At the first-quarter results stage, GE said it was navigating supply-chain pressures, while Safran said supply chains and inflation were ""two major watch items.""

Boeing said on May 11 that 737 production had been slowed by shortages of a single type of wiring connector.

Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), whose Pratt & Whitney engines compete with CFM on the Airbus A320neo, said on April 26 it was facing supply-chain constraints across its business.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/supply-chain-labour-snags-delay-cfm-jet-engines--sources-2829294,0.07,0.884,0.046,-0.9561

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Army said on Friday it has awarded a contract worth $625 million to Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp for anti-aircraft Stinger missiles in order to replenish stocks sent to Ukraine.

The shoulder-fired anti-aircraft Stinger missiles made by Raytheon (NYSE: ) were in hot demand in Ukraine, where they have successfully stopped Russian assaults from the air, and in neighboring European countries which fear they may also need to beat back Russian forces.

U.S. troops have limited use for the current supply of Stingers - a lightweight, self-contained weapon that can be deployed quickly to defend against helicopters, airplanes, drones and even cruise missiles - but the United States needs to maintain its supply on hand while it develops the next generation of a ""man-portable air defense system.""

Since February, the United States has shipped about 1,400 Stingers to Ukraine. U.S. allies also want to restock the weapons they shipped to Ukraine in recent months.

The contract for up to 1,468 Stingers was awarded on Wednesday, according to a document reviewed by Reuters, and was worth up to $687 million with options added in. There was no timeline for completion of the work, but it was estimated delivery could take up to 30 months.

The president of Raytheon Missiles & Defense, Wes Kremer, said the order will help ""fulfill our current foreign military sale order, while replenishing Stingers provided to Ukraine and accelerating production.""

Separately, the Pentagon is searching for Stinger missiles that are already in inventory, but need to be refurbished, according to the document.

On May 6 the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, Bill LaPlante, said he had aimed to sign a contract by the end of May and that the intent was to replace the Stinger missiles sent to Ukraine one-for-one.

The Pentagon and Raytheon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Stinger production line was closed in December 2020, the Pentagon has said. In July 2021, Raytheon won a contract to manufacture more Stingers, but mainly for international governments, according to the U.S. Army.

Raytheon Chief Executive Greg Hayes told analysts during an April 26 conference call that the U.S. Department of Defense has not purchased a Stinger in 18 years.

""Some of the components are no longer commercially available, and so we're going to have to go out and redesign some of the electronics in the missile of the seeker head. That's going to take us a little bit of time.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration plans to sell Ukraine four MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones that can be armed with Hellfire missiles for battlefield use against Russia, three people familiar with the situation said.

The sale of the General Atomics-made drones could still be blocked by Congress, the sources said, adding that there is also a risk of a last minute policy reversal that could scuttle the plan, which has been under review at the Pentagon for several weeks.

Ukraine has been using several types of smaller shorter range unmanned aerial systems against Russian forces that invaded the country in late February. They include the AeroVironment (NASDAQ: ) RQ-20 Puma AE, and the Turkish Bayraktar-TB2.

But the Gray Eagle represents a leap in technology because it can fly up to 30 or more hours depending on its mission and can gather huge amounts of data for intelligence purposes. Gray Eagles, the Army's version of the more widely known Predator drone, can also carry up to eight powerful Hellfire missiles.

The sale is significant because it puts an advanced reusable U.S. system capable of multiple deep strikes on the battlefield against Russia for the first time.

The administration of President Joe Biden intends to notify Congress of the potential sale to Ukraine in the coming days with a public announcement expected after that, a U.S. official said.

A White House spokesperson referred inquiries to the Pentagon and a Pentagon spokesperson said there was ""nothing to announce.""

Money from the recently passed $40 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative has been set aside to fund both the possible sale and the training needed for the drones, the U.S. official and one of the people familiar said.

""Generally the MQ-1C is a much larger aircraft with a max take-off weight around three times that of the Bayraktar-TB2, with commensurate advantages in payload capacity, range, and endurance,"" said drone expert Dan Gettinger with the Vertical Flight Society.

The MQ-1C is also compatible with a greater variety of munitions than the Bayraktar-TB2. The Ukrainian Bayraktars are equipped with 22 kg (48 pound) Turkish-made MAM-L missiles, around half the weight of a Hellfire.

Training on the UAV system made by General Atomics usually takes months, Gettinger said, but a notional plan to train experienced Ukrainian maintainers and operators in a handful of weeks has been proposed in recent weeks, the sources said.

Arming the drones with Hellfire missiles will be done via a future Presidential Drawdown Authority once training on the drones has been completed, the U.S. official and one of the sources said.

Up until an announcement on Wednesday that Ukraine would get four HIMARS rocket systems, the Pentagon has stressed that smaller systems such as Javelin anti-tank systems and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which allies are shipping to Ukraine via truck near-daily, are most useful.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Raytheon Technologies Corp said on Tuesday it is moving its headquarters to Arlington, Virginia, saying it will boost its efforts to serve U.S. government and commercial aerospace customers.

The Waltham, Massachusetts-based aerospace and defense company said it had not accepted or sought any financial incentives for the move to near the U.S. capital and the Pentagon.

Raytheon (NYSE: ), which plans to make the move in the third quarter, currently employs about 130 corporate staff in Arlington and does not expect that number to change significantly, a spokesman said. The move will not impact its Massachusetts facilities, he added.

Last month, Boeing (NYSE: ) Co said it was moving its headquarters to Arlington from Chicago.

Boeing also plans to develop a research and technology hub in the Arlington area.

""The region makes strategic sense for our global headquarters given its proximity to our customers and stakeholders, and its access to world-class engineering and technical talent,"" Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said last month.

Raytheon and Boeing are joining other major U.S. defense contractors that are headquartered in the Washington area, including Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) in nearby Bethesda, Maryland and Northrop Grumman (NYSE: ) in Falls Church, Virginia.

Raytheon's new global headquarters office will be in Arlington's Rosslyn neighborhood alongside the Raytheon Intelligence and Space business, the company said.

Raytheon also owns Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney.

(Reuters) -General Electric Co said on Monday Chief Executive Larry Culp will also head its aviation unit effective immediately, replacing John Slattery, as the industrial conglomerate prepares to split into three public companies.

Slattery, who has been at the helm at the company's jet-engine unit since Sept. 2020, will become the unit's chief commercial officer.

GE also named Otis Worldwide (NYSE: ) Corp executive Rahul Ghai as GE Aviation's new chief financial officer. Ghai played a key role in steering Otis following its breakup from United Technologies (NYSE: ) in 2020.

GE plans to spin off its healthcare business into a separate publicly traded company next year. It would combine its power and renewable energy units, and spin off that operation in 2024. Following the split, it will become an aviation company, headed by Culp.

John Walsh, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said the leadership shuffle has created ""known and highly regarded"" management team at the jet-engine unit, which is also GE's cash cow.

While the company's aviation business is grappling with persistent supply chain and labor shortages, GE expects it to post at least 20% revenue growth this year on the back of a recovery in the global airline industry from the pandemic-induced slump.

GE's shares were down 0.15% at $66.90 in afternoon trade.

QUEST FOR CLARITY

Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair, reckons the leadership changes are directed at clearing up any ambiguity surrounding the aviation unit's management structure as it tries to attract ""really good"" independent directors to its board.

""They need to know who will be running the executive management team on each business before they sign up,"" Heymann said.

The quest for clarity echoed Dave Calhoun's recent decision to cement his long-term position as chief executive of Boeing (NYSE: ).

Some industry sources said Irish-born Slattery's position may also have been clouded by his lack of U.S. citizenship as he waits for a U.S. passport. GE is a major supplier to the Pentagon.

A GE spokesperson said the company has worked ""compliantly"" with the U.S. Department of Defense over the course of Slattery's tenure, and Monday's announcement will not result in any changes to its military business.

In his new role, Slattery, an industry high-flier who headed the civil unit of Brazil's Embraer before a planned takeover of the regional planemaker by Boeing collapsed in 2020, will tackle the multi-dimensional chess game of jet engine strategy.

Engine makers and airplane manufacturers are involved in the early stages of a mating game that will define air travel for decades as planemakers ponder what type of propulsion will be needed for the next generation of medium-haul jets in the 2030s.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States successfully tested two Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) hypersonic missiles recently, the Pentagon said on Wednesday, amid growing concerns Russia and China have had more success developing their own hypersonic weapons.

The U.S. Air Force confirmed it successfully tested its Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) booster on Tuesday off the California coast. Reuters reported the ARRW test earlier on Wednesday in which the booster was carried aloft under the wing of a B-52H before it was launched. In previous tests, the weapon did not detach from the plane.

""This second successful test demonstrates ARRW's ability to reach and withstand operational hypersonic speeds, collect crucial data for use in further flight tests, and validate safe separation from the aircraft,"" Lockheed said in a statement.

Air Force Brigadier General Heath Collins, program executive officer, Armament Directorate, said, ""We have now completed our booster test series and are ready to move forward to all-up-round testing later this year.""

The ""all-up-round"" includes the booster and the warhead.

Hypersonic weapons travel in the upper atmosphere at more than five times the speed of sound, or about 6,200 km (3,853 miles) per hour.

In a separate hypersonic weapon test, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) confirmed it successfully performed the first test of its Operational Fires hypersonic weapon.

The test was conducted at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.

The successful tests show progress among the myriad U.S. hypersonic weapons development efforts, which have in cases been beleaguered by failed tests, growing questions about cost and increasing concerns the United States is falling behind in what has become a superpower arms race.

Operational Fires is a ground-launched system that will ""rapidly and precisely engage critical, time-sensitive targets while penetrating modern enemy air defenses."" DARPA has requested and received $45 million for OpFires in fiscal year 2022.

One of Lockheed Martin's concepts for the DARPA weapon is to use an exiting High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launcher, like those sent to Ukraine, to launch the weapon.

These successful tests come after a failed June 29 test flight of a different type of hypersonic weapon, the Common Hypersonic Glide Body, at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii.

Defense contractors hope to capitalize on the shift to hypersonic weapons not only by building them, but also by developing new detection and defeat mechanisms.

Arms makers like Lockheed, Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp have all touted their hypersonic weapons programs to investors as the world's focus shifted to the new arms race for an emerging class of weapon.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-successfully-tested-lockheed-hypersonic-missile-this-week-sources-2846886,0.08,0.832,0.088,0.1018

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of HIMARS rocket systems to Estonia, missiles to Norway and torpedoes to South Korea in separate deals that could be worth more than $1.5 billion in all, the Pentagon said on Friday.

The sales comes as European countries increase arms purchases after Russia invaded Ukraine, heightening security fears across the region.

HIMARS systems donated by the United States and allies are being employed by Ukraine in its fight with Russia.

The package approved for Estonia would include up to six M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers, munitions, support equipment, spares and technical support, the Pentagon said.

The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the possible sale to Estonia alongside the two other foreign military sales on Friday.

The State Department's separate approvals of the potential sale of medium-range air-to-air missiles and related equipment for Norway in a deal valued at up to $950 million, and MK 54 Lightweight Torpedoes to South Korea for an estimated value of $130 million also were made public on Friday.

Despite approval by the State Department, the notification does not indicate that contracts have been signed or that negotiations have concluded.

The Pentagon said Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) was the prime contractor for the HIMARS systems and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) was the prime contractor for the up to 205 AIM-120 C-8 or D Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air missiles.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-state-department-approves-potential-sale-of-himars-to-estonia--pentagon-2847883,0.035,0.869,0.096,0.9437

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has successfully tested a Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp air-breathing hypersonic weapon capable of speeds faster than five times the speed of sound, making it the third successful test of that class of weapon since 2013, the Pentagon said in a statement on Monday.

The development program for the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) is being run by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. Both Raytheon (NYSE: ) and Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) are competing for the ultimate contract award.

Air-breathing vehicles use air captured from the atmosphere to achieve sustained propulsion. Different propulsion types work in the vacuum of space.

There have been four air-breathing hypersonic weapons tests since September. Raytheon's product has been successful both times, and Lockheed had one successful test and one failure.

""Advancing our nation's hypersonic capabilities is a critical national imperative, and this was an important step forward. Having back-to-back successful flight tests gives us even greater confidence in the technical maturity of our HAWC prototype,"" Wes Kremer, president of Raytheon's Missiles & Defense business unit, said.

During the flight test, after releasing HAWC from an aircraft and accelerating to hypersonic speeds using the scramjet engine, Raytheon said in a statement, ""The vehicle flew a trajectory that engineers designed to intentionally stress the weapon concept to explore its limits and further validate digital performance models.""

This success marks the third successful test in a string of hypersonic weapons across different U.S. programs in development.

These successful tests come after a failed June 29 test flight of a different type of hypersonic weapon, the Common Hypersonic Glide Body, at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii.

The United States and its global rivals are increasing their pace to build hypersonic weapons - the next generation of arms that rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms.

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney said on Tuesday it expects to have engine deliveries to Airbus for its A320 airliner back on track by early 2023 at the latest and to be able to meet the planemaker's schedule for upping output to 75 aircraft per month by some time in 2026.

""In regard to where we are with Airbus PO (purchase orders), our intent is to try and climb that back this year,"" Rick Deurloo, P&W's president commercial engines, told reporters at Farnborough Airshow on Tuesday, adding that it would be no later than early next year.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury expects delays in engine supplies which have been holding back aircraft deliveries to peak at mid-year, according to a report on Monday.

Airbus wants to raise A320 production rates to 75 aircraft monthly over the next three years. The world's largest planemaker plans to raise A320 output to 65 a month by mid-2023 from about 50 currently.

Deurloo said he did not doubt the rate would be hit, but it was a question of timing.

""I think Airbus would like to get us in sooner than what we think we'll be capable of,"" he said. ""We'd like to hit that rate sometime in the 2026 timeframe, may not be for the full calendar year, but we'd like to at least try and hit it.""

He said Airbus was pushing P&W ""to do better"", but it had to balance demands, including the new GTF Advantage engine coming into service.

President Shane Eddy said the U.S. company, a subsidiary of Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), was battling labour shortages and other challenges in the supply chain.

""Our output in the second quarter was largely where we had said it was going to be in recovery,"" he said.

""Certainly we're not happy about the position that we're in right now, we're not happy about putting stress on our customers, whether it's on the OEM side or the flying fleet that's out there expecting to operate,"" he said. ""But I think we're seeing that recovery.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pratt--whitney-sees-airbus-a320-engine-deliveries-back-on-track-by-early-2023-2848924,0.049,0.895,0.055,0.1392

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted to move ahead with a slimmed-down version of legislation to provide billions of dollars in subsidies and tax credits for the semiconductor industry, hoping to ease a shortage that has disrupted production in industries from automobiles to electronics and high-tech weapons.

The Senate backed by 64 to 34 a procedural measure setting the stage for potential votes to pass the legislation in the Senate and House of Representatives by the end of next week.

The bill is part of a broad effort across the government to push back against a rising China and ease supply-chain problems, in this case by decreasing U.S. companies' reliance on foreign-made semiconductors.

The final text was not released before the procedural vote, but Senate aides said the measure includes about $54 billion in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor companies, as well as a new, four-year 25% tax credit to encourage companies to build plants in the United States. The tax credit is estimated to be worth about $24 billion.

Officials from President Joe Biden's administration had urged Congress to pass a semiconductor bill before leaving Washington for their annual August recess, saying it would not only create and preserve U.S. jobs, but also bolster national security.

INDUSTRY WANTED FUNDING

Semiconductor companies have also been clamoring for action.

Intel Corp (NASDAQ: ) said in January it would spend $20 billion on a factory in Ohio after breaking ground on two new plants in Arizona last year. That could grow to $100 billion with eight total fabrication plants and would be the largest investment on record in Ohio, Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said in January.

However, he added that without government funding, ""it's just not going to happen as fast and it's not going to grow as big as quickly.""

Senator Maria Cantwell, the Democratic chairperson of the Senate Commerce Committee, urged lawmakers to vote yes.

""Today's vote is really about whether we're going to stop shipping jobs overseas, and instead invest in American R&D. If we invest in American R&D, then we will see the plant being talked about in Ohio get built instead of being immediately built in Europe,"" she said.

Many major weapons systems also require sophisticated computer chips. For example, Javelin missile systems made by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) and Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) each contain 250 microprocessors. These systems have been in high demand by Ukrainian soldiers as they work to repel the Russian invasion of Ukraine, an action that Moscow calls ""a special operation"".

The current bill is a pared-down version of rival measures in the Senate and House that stalled before becoming law, even though efforts to counter China are policies generally backed by both Republicans and Biden's Democrats, who narrowly control Congress.

The Senate approved a bipartisan $250 billion bill boosting spending on technology research and development in June 2021, one of the first major pieces of legislation passed after Democrats gained their slim control of the chamber.

However, the legislation was never taken up in the House, which earlier this year passed its own bill with almost no Republican support. That measure included provisions to boost chipmakers, but also billions of dollars for other supply chains and the Global Climate Change Initiative, which Republicans oppose.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/months-later-us-senate-tries-again-for-computer-chip-bill-to-compete-with-china-2848764,0.032,0.873,0.096,0.9911

FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - The global air industry is in the midst of a post-pandemic rebound, but supply chain problems have left suppliers and manufacturers scrambling to source everything from raw materials to small electronic components to keep production moving.

From multinationals to family-run stockists, few have been spared the impact of shortages or delays. As a result, this week's Farnborough Airshow has been more about the factory floor than the usual shop window for new orders.

""We are keeping our head above water, keeping the flow happening, but the gymnastics required to make that happen are as difficult now as they have ever been,"" Stephen Timm, president of industry giant Collins Aerospace, told Reuters.

At the other end of the spectrum, where suppliers lack the clout of a Collins or Honeywell (NASDAQ: ), things are even more uncertain.

""At the moment it's extremely challenging because of the lack of raw materials,"" said Paul Wingfield, business development manager at Stokenchurch, England-based Aircraft Materials, which supplies alloys including aluminium, nickel, magnesium, titanium and nickel for the industry.

Not only are the mills that his firm works with having trouble finding raw materials, but distributors are wary of holding onto inventory when there is a risk of recession.

""Nobody knows what the economy is going to do, so nobody's willing to invest in stock at the moment,"" Wingfield said.

In conversations at this week's show, suppliers say material and parts delays have meant pushing manufacturers to order earlier, while manufacturers like Boeing (NYSE: ) have found themselves wading into the supply chain to keep parts flowing.

""We're going deeper into the supply chain than we've ever had to go to help our suppliers solve problems,"" said Cory Gionet, Boeing's vice president in charge of supply chains for commercial airplanes.

Earlier this year, Boeing said its 737 MAX aircraft production and deliveries were hit by shortages of a particular wiring connector.

Suppliers face lengthening lead times to source materials or components that can now run six months to over a year, threatening the manufacturers' plans to ramp up output.

To guarantee parts delivery, some suppliers are pushing manufacturers to order many months in advance, even if it means suppliers have to tie up capital by holding onto inventory for longer.

Switching their own suppliers can be almost impossible in a highly-regulated industry where components have to undergo rigorous approval processes.

""It's not a case of picking up and going to a different supplier, the validation process for doing that is actually often longer than the lead time,"" said Neil Lawrence, business development engineer at Woking, England-based Magnet Schultz.

It makes solenoids - electromagnetic valves - used in everything from airplane hydraulics controls to air conditioning. Those valves range in price from a few hundred to tens of thousands of pounds.

Shortages of electronics components mean some will not be delivered for over a year.

""We're getting terrible, terrible lead times on some parts,"" Lawrence said.

'NO CHANCE AT ALL'

Supply chain problems come at a time when the industry is eager to build ever more planes.

Airbus wants to raise A320 production rates to 75 single-aisle aircraft monthly over the next three years, from 50 now. But delays in engine supplies have held back aircraft deliveries.

Engine maker Pratt & Whitney, like Collins a unit of Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), said this week it aimed to get its engine deliveries for the A320 back on track by early 2023 as it battles labour shortages and supply chain snags.

""Certainly we're not happy about the position that we're in right now,"" Pratt & Whitney president Shane Eddy said.

Even so, Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury told Reuters the show had brought slightly more comfort on engine delays.

But France's Dassault Aviation told a results presentation it was ""very concerned"" about supply chains.

Rochford, England-based UFC Aerospace, part of the FMT Group, provides structural fasteners for airplanes and its biggest customer is Boeing.

The company has recently been quoted lead times for ""S80,"" an aerospace-grade stainless steel alloy that contains nickel, of six months, or more than three times normal.

General manager Barry Vinneall said UFC had been communicating to customers like Boeing that they need to provide orders 12 months out to guarantee delivery.

""If we order it now, we can still deliver in March,"" Vinneall said. ""But if you ask us in November, we've got no chance at all of having it by March.""

This means that UFC has to carry more inventory, which is an additional financial strain after the coronavirus pandemic shut down air travel and hit the industry hard.

But Vinneall said UFC was financially sound enough to allow customers longer to pay off invoices.

""If all of a sudden they don't have to pay us for 90 days instead of 30, there's a good chance that we'll win more work,"" he said.

Magnet Schultz's Lawrence said the company had also made it clear to customers that its lead times for electronic components were now over a year.

""Understandably, they're not happy with lead times going out 50 to 60 weeks, but they're also quite in tune with the market,"" Lawrence said. ""They know what's going on, they can see what's happening.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysissupply-chain-snags-threaten-to-slow-air-industry-takeoff-2850742,0.077,0.863,0.06,-0.929

CHICAGO (Reuters) -General Electric Co on Tuesday surprised Wall Street with higher quarterly profit and positive cash flow as recovery in the aviation industry propelled its jet engine business, sending its shares higher.

The Boston-based industrial conglomerate, however, said it was still grappling with supply-chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, which would pressure earnings this as well as next year.

""It is a challenging operating environment,"" Chief Executive Larry Culp told Reuters in an interview.

Supply-chain bottlenecks have made it tougher for the company to deliver products to customers on time. To get around the problem, it is holding higher levels of inventory.

GE said supply-chain and macroeconomic pressures shaved off 5 percentage points from its revenue in the quarter through June.

It reiterated that its full-year results this year were on track to hit the low end of its forecast, but trimmed the full-year free cash flow forecast by about $1 billion.

In January, it projected adjusted profit in 2022 to be in the range of $2.80 to $3.50 per share and expected to generate $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion in free cash flow.

Culp said a ""more conservative view"" on part of the company was warranted due to economic and policy uncertainties.

The company's shares were up 5.12% at $71.86 in morning trade.

While GE has yet to put out an earnings forecast for next year, Culp said profit and free cash flow in 2023 are now expected to be lower than its previous estimate.

A strong recovery in air travel, meanwhile, has bolstered demand at its engine business, which is the company's cash cow. The unit reported a 27% year-on-year jump in revenue in the second quarter on the back of higher shop visits and spare part sales.

GE expects demand at its aviation unit to remain strong, resulting in more than 20% revenue growth and $3.8 to $4.3 billion operating profit this year.

Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, whose Pratt & Whitney segment makes jet engines, has also reported a jump in demand for its engines and aftermarket services.

Profit at GE's healthcare unit, however, is expected to suffer this year due to supply chain disruptions, and freight and raw material inflation.

Those issues along with the expiration of a U.S. wind energy production tax credit have taken a toll on the company's renewable energy business. As a result, GE said it no longer expects an improvement in the business in the second half of the year.

Adjusted profit for the quarter through June came in at 78 cents a share, above analysts' expectations. Quarterly revenue at $18.6 billion also topped Wall Street estimates.

The company reported $162 million in free cash flow in the second quarter.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ge-cuts-free-cash-flow-forecast-2853886,0.056,0.796,0.148,0.995

CHICAGO/PARIS (Reuters) - Major aerospace companies are sounding the alarm on their supply chains as shortages ranging from raw materials to castings or semiconductor chips pressure earnings and crimp the industry's ability to capitalize on roaring travel demand.

Worries about the supply of parts, materials and labour dominated last week's Farnborough Airshow and are now working their way into published quarterly outlooks.

Airbus cut its full-year jet delivery forecast by 3% and slowed a planned increase in factory production, noting pressure on the engine sector. The world's largest planemaker has 26 A320-family jets without engines.

U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE: ) Co cut estimates for 737 MAX deliveries this year and warned that supply-chain constraints had capped its ability to ramp up production despite ""significant"" demand.

""We continue to work hard on predictability of the delivery chain,"" Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said on Wednesday.

On Thursday, France's Safran (EPA: ) - co-owner of engine maker CFM alongside General Electric (NYSE: ) - warned supply-chain problems would last well into 2023 even as it raised some financial forecasts on the back of currency movements.

Chief Executive Olivier Andries, who had repeatedly voiced concerns about Airbus's plans for a record hike in aircraft production, said the move by the European planemaker to temper its output plans for 2022 and 2023 was ""adapting to reality"".

""This is unlikely to be a quick fix,"" said Agency Partners analyst Nick Cunningham, adding that the main problem for Safran involved supplies of castings and forgings from the United States where hiring skilled welders is a major headache.

The world's largest aerospace contractor, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), is dealing with shortages of microelectronics, rocket motors and structural castings. It has a total of 330 suppliers on its watch list.

Chief Executive Greg Hayes said it is adding second or third sources for parts, but Raytheon (NYSE: ), which bought United Technologies in 2020, doesn’t expect these pressures to ease until 2023.

'ON OUR TOES'

The industry is grappling with supply issues at a time when much of the air travel market except China is booming after a two-years slump. Delays in aircraft production and deliveries have made it tougher for airlines to add capacity.

United Airlines, which is aiming to operate more flights next year, has flagged delays in aircraft delivery as a risk to its capacity plans.

To stabilize production and address shortages of engines, raw materials and semiconductors, Boeing, for example, has parachuted more specialists into its suppliers' facilities. It is also carrying higher inventory to deal with any snags.

In public, aerospace executives talk about working together but in practice small suppliers say the knock on the door from the final customer, Boeing or Airbus, can be a stressful wake-up call. Few are willing to discuss their glitches publicly.

To be sure, manufacturers of all shapes and sizes have been struggling to produce enough to feed current demand and restock inventory after the pandemic fractured global supply chains.

But until now, aerospace has avoided the scale of disruption faced by auto makers and machinery companies, as Boeing and Airbus were building significantly fewer jets than before the pandemic. Airbus is about half-way back to pre-pandemic output.

A pick-up in demand has brought the strains to the fore.

""This is a ramp(-up) that's going to have us all very much on our toes,"" said General Electric Chief Executive Larry Culp.

Culp, whose company supplies jet engines to both Airbus and Boeing, said there is ""no silver bullet"" to the supply-chain problems as it is a ""multi-year task"".

GE has deployed one-fifth of its engineering team to deal with the bottlenecks, which emanate from various suppliers including family-run companies, according to industry sources. It is working to drive up production rates.

Culp, who is broadening his role to include the aviation unit that led the conglomerate to higher-than-expected profit in the second quarter, said the measures had increased supplier throughput by as much as 30%.

Still, supply-chain pressures shaved off 9 percentage points from GE's second-quarter aviation revenue. Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury told Reuters last week he was leaving Farnborough with a ""bit more comfort"" about engines, while Culp this week stressed the need for ""predictability and stability"".",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/supply-disruptions-cloud-aerospace-outlook-after-solid-first-half-2856901,0.08,0.878,0.042,-0.9655

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower after a choppy session on Tuesday, with geopolitical tensions flaring after U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan.

Pelosi said her trip demonstrated American solidarity with the Chinese-claimed self-ruled island, but China condemned that first such visit in 25 years as a threat to peace and stability.

Heavy hitters Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Visa (NYSE: ) lost 1.1% and 2.4% respectively, weighing on the S&P 500. All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes lost ground, led lower by real estate, which lost 1.3%. Financials dipped 1.1%.

Shares of chipmakers heavily exposed to China were mixed. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) rallied 2.6% ahead of its quarterly report after the bell.

Industrial bellwether Caterpillar (NYSE: ) tumbled 5.8% after warning of a bigger drop in demand for its excavators in property crisis-hit China, piling more pain on the industrial bellwether grappling with supply-chain disruptions.

Financial markets have been roiled in recent months by the Ukraine war, soaring inflation and tightening financial conditions.

U.S. job openings in June fell by the most in just over two years, as demand for workers eased in the retail and wholesale trade industries. Overall the labor market remained tight.

Since the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points in July, investors have been speculating about whether the central bank's largest hikes are behind it.

""The market has to get really comfortable that they have fully baked in all the Fed's rate hikes, and I think that remains an open question,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. ""The challenges and supply constraints aren't necessarily done. They aren't done and gone yet.""

Shares of U.S. defense companies Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ), Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE: ) and L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: ) Inc rallied for much of the session, ending with gains between 0.5% and 2.3%. The United States is Taiwan's main supporter and arms supplier.

The S&P 500 declined 0.66% to end the session at 4,091.32 points.

The Nasdaq declined 0.16% to 12,348.76 points, while declined 1.23% to 32,396.30 points.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively heavy, with 11.2 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 10.8 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

The CBOE volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, eased from the day's high of 24.68 points.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration's next security assistance package for Ukraine is expected to be $1 billion, one of the largest so far, and include munitions for long-range weapons and armored medical transport vehicles, three sources briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday.

The package is expected to be announced as early as Monday and would add to about $8.8 billion in aid the United States has given Ukraine since Russia's invasion on Feb. 24.

The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that President Joe Biden had not yet signed the next weapons package. They cautioned that weapons packages can change in value and content before they are signed.

However, if signed in its current form, it would be valued at $1 billion and include munitions for HIMARS, NASAMS surface-to-air missile system ammunition and as many as 50 M113 armored medical transports.

The new package follows a recent https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/pentagon-approves-plan-treat-ukrainian-troops-us-hospital-germany-official-2022-07-26 Pentagon decision to allow Ukrainians to receive medical treatment at a U.S. military hospital in Germany near Ramstein air base.

Last Monday, the Pentagon announced a separate security assistance package for Ukraine valued at up to $550 million, including additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS).

The White House declined to comment on the package.

The new package would be funded under the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), in which the president can authorize the transfer of articles and services from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency.

HIMARS play a key role in the artillery duel between Ukraine and Russia has been described as ""grinding"" with very little movement of the front line in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.

Since Russian troops poured over the border in February in what Putin termed a ""special military operation"", the conflict has settled into a war of attrition fought primarily in the east and south of Ukraine.

Moscow is trying to gain control of the largely Russian-speaking Donbas, comprised of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, where pro-Moscow separatists seized territory after the Kremlin annexed Crimea to the south in 2014.

So far the United States has sent 16 HIMARS to Ukraine and on July 1 pledged to send two National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS).

It was unclear if the NASAMS launchers, made jointly by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp and Norway's Kongsberg, are already in Ukraine if the munitions were for launchers donated by another country, or if they were being prepositioned.

The United States previously committed 200 M113 armored personnel carriers to Ukraine.

The armored personnel carriers outfitted with medical equipment could make the fight with Russia more survivable for Ukrainian troops who could then be sent to Germany for further medical treatment.

The Kyiv government said in June that 100 to 200 Ukrainian troops were being killed per day.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/exclusiveus-readies-new-1-billion-ukraine-weapons-package-2865656,0.062,0.87,0.068,-0.1911

WASHINGTON/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A Brazilian military request to buy Javelin anti-tank missiles worth as much as $100 million has been stalled in Washington for months due to U.S. lawmakers' concerns about far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, including his attacks on Brazil's electoral system, multiple U.S. sources told Reuters.

Brazil's bid to acquire some 220 Javelins was originally made when former President Donald Trump, a Bolsonaro ally, was in the White House. The State Department gave its blessing to the proposal late last year, despite objections from some lower-ranking U.S. officials, according to two people familiar with the matter.

But the confidential deal, which has not been previously reported, has since become mired in procedural limbo amid mounting concerns among Democratic lawmakers over Bolsonaro's Trump-like questioning of voting integrity ahead of Brazil's Oct. 2 election, the sources said.

Brazil's request for the cutting-edge U.S.-made missiles, which have won fame for their effective use by Ukrainian forces against Russian armor, has been delayed by a Democratic-led effort to send a message to Bolsonaro and his military.

""It's being slow-walked on Capitol Hill and isn't going anywhere anytime soon"" because of misgivings about Bolsonaro, said a source who has followed the proposed deal.

The holdup underlines the impact Bolsonaro's undemocratic rhetoric is already having on Latin America's biggest country. It also gives a glimpse of how Brazil could become more isolated internationally if Bolsonaro were to follow Trump's example and refuse to accept any election loss to his leftist rival, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

President Joe Biden's administration, scarred by Trump supporters' Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol, has become increasingly anxious about Bolsonaro's authoritarian comments, sending delegations to Brasilia to urge caution.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin brought a message of respect for democracy to Brazil in a meeting of regional defense ministers in July. That followed a visit last year by CIA director William Burns in which he told Bolsonaro's aides he should stop undermining confidence in the country's electoral process.

Bolsonaro, who trails Lula in the polls, has ignored them. Instead, he has continued to question the credibility of Brazil's electronic voting system and claimed fraud in recent elections without providing evidence.

'BRAZIL DOESN'T NEED THEM'

The potential post-election role of Brazil's armed forces, which oversaw a military dictatorship for two decades following a 1964 coup, is an open question. Bolsonaro has called for the military, Latin America's largest, to undertake its own parallel vote count, saying ""the army is on our side.""

Washington is also concerned by environmental backsliding under Bolsonaro, as well as his friendly relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose Ukraine invasion he has refused to condemn.

Manufactured by defense giants Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, the Javelin has become one of the world's best-known weapons due to its success against Russian tanks in the Ukraine war.

Brazil faces no similar threats, prompting questions about why it would need such firepower, sources said. Brazil's military mainly focuses on securing its borders, among the world's longest, and international peacekeeping missions.

""Brazil doesn't need them,"" said a former congressional aide who worked on weapons issues.

Another source said the State Department's support for the sale showed it wanted to satisfy Brazil's weapons wish-list to help nurture relations with one of Washington's most important allied militaries in the region.

Bolsonaro's office directed requests for comment to the defense ministry, which did not respond to a list of questions.

The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.

The request came in 2020 at a time of warming ties between the United States and Brazil under Trump and Bolsonaro, two blustery nationalists. In 2019, Trump designated Brazil a major non-NATO ally, allowing it greater access to U.S.-made weaponry.

The deal sailed through the Trump-era bureaucracy and was inherited by Biden, a Democrat less friendly toward Bolsonaro than his Republican predecessor.

Still, Biden's State Department gave the deal a preliminary nod after what one person familiar with the matter described as only cursory discussions, overlooking concerns of U.S. diplomats in Brazil and lower-level officials in Washington.

""There are those within State working levels who have expressed reservations about this sale given Bolsonaro's actions and rhetoric and certain past actions of Brazil's military and security services,"" said a U.S. government source. ""Such concerns are not shared among Defense Department officials nor State leadership.""

The State Department then sent the proposed sale for an ""informal"" review by the two Democratic chairs and two Republican ranking members of Congress' foreign relations committees. Congressional sources say it has not advanced due to the concerns of lawmakers, including Senator Bob Menendez and Representative Gregory Meeks, Biden's fellow Democrats.

They have peppered the State Department with questions, ranging from Bolsonaro's human rights record to whether Brazil needs such weapons, according to one congressional source, suggesting they at least want to delay it until after Brazil's elections.

""We do not comment on arms cases under current review,"" said a spokesperson for the committee, adding: ""Chairman Meeks takes a range of considerations into account when reviewing such transfers, such as the broader range of diplomatic and security dynamics as well as human rights concerns.""

There have been no indications that the two senior Republicans also reviewing the Brazilian request, Senator Jim Risch and Representative Michael McCaul, have expressed any reservations, sources said.

The State Department has acknowledged to the lawmakers that the Javelins do not safeguard against any specific threat Brazil faces, a U.S. official said. But State has argued that Brazil's bid to upgrade its anti-armor capacity is legitimate, and it seeks a reasonable number of missiles, the official added.

FORMIDABLE OBSTACLES

Despite tensions between Biden and Bolsonaro, Washington has remained open to selling weapons to Brasilia.

""The view is that Brazil has the right to procure military equipment as it sees fit and in accordance with our laws,"" a senior Biden administration official told Reuters.

Even if the sale does move to the next phase - a full congressional review - it would still face formidable obstacles.

Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, who chairs the Western Hemisphere subcommittee, said he would want to examine any sale closely. Selling weapons to Brazil, he told Reuters, is ""not something that I just would immediately feel like we should do.""

Demand for Javelins has soared since the start of the Ukraine war. So even if the deal is approved, it could take years for Brazil to receive the missiles due to a backlog of orders, with priority given to other U.S. partners.

If the request is denied, sources said Brazil has other options - chiefly the HJ-12, China's cheaper version of the Javelin.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusivebolsonaro-election-concerns-stall-us-javelin-missiles-sale-to-brazilsources-2866399,0.088,0.815,0.097,0.7001

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing Co (N: ) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE: ) are joining a White House-backed compact to help smaller U.S.-based suppliers increase the use of 3D printing and other advanced manufacturing technologies.

The voluntary program, unveiled by President Joe Biden in May, seeks to boost suppliers' use of additive manufacturing (AM).

Driven by 3D printing, the technology allows complex shapes to be built in layers from particles of plastic or metal. The Biden administration views it as an innovation that will enable U.S. manufacturers to flourish and create jobs.

The program, Additive Manufacturing Forward (AM Forward) is organized by non-profit Applied Science & Technology Research Organization of America (ASTRO America).

""The supply chain crisis isn’t just about building out ports. It’s about building up parts – right here in America’s small business factories,"" said ASTRO America's CEO, Neal Orringer.

GE Aviation, Siemens Energy, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), Honeywell (NASDAQ: ) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) were the initial companies to make commitments.

The manufacturers say they will purchase additively produced parts from smaller U.S. suppliers; train supplier workers on new additive technologies; provide technical assistance; and engage in standards development and certification.

Boeing and Northrop Grumman both aim to increase the number of small- and medium-sized suppliers competing over quote packages for products using additive manufacturing. Boeing will also aim to increase its qualified small and medium supplier capacity by 30% and provide technical guidance to meet qualification requirements.

""We know the competitiveness of the U.S. industrial base, including Boeing, relies on the capability of a wide spectrum of suppliers producing and post-processing critical aerospace parts,"" said Melissa Orme, Boeing's vice president for additive manufacturing.

Such technologies can reduce part lead times and materials cost by 90%, and cut energy use in half.

The White House says not enough American companies are using 3D printing or other high-performance advanced manufacturing technologies.

A Biden administration official told Reuters the program could expand to the automotive or semiconductor sectors.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is scheduled to speak to U.S. arms makers and military leaders on Sept. 21, when he is expected to make an appeal for more weapons for his country's defense against Russia, according to an advance notice of the speech seen by Reuters.

Zelenskiy was set to speak by video link before a conference hosted by the National Defense Industrial Association in Austin, Texas, in his first-ever speech to the U.S. defense industry.

Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine's minister of defense, was also slated to appear at the Future Force Capabilities conference and appeal for support for the country's fight against Russia's invasion, now more than six months on.

The association's members include Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp and Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ), which jointly produce Javelin antitank weapons that have been used by Ukraine.

Those companies and other top weapons makers, including Boeing (NYSE: ) Co, Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE: ), General Dynamics Corp (NYSE: ) and L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: ) Inc, were present at an April meeting called by the Pentagon to discuss Ukraine's weapons needs.

Ukrainian forces were charging through an expanding area of previously Russian-held territory in the east on Friday after bursting through the frontline in a surprise breakthrough that could mark a major turning point in the war.

Ukraine would like to receive an additional 50 to 80 multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) from foreign partners, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, said on Friday.

The latest U.S. weapons aid package includes more ammunition, humvees and anti-tank systems.

(Reuters) - Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp said on Wednesday delivery of some of its Pratt & Whitney large commercial engines may slip into the first quarter as the aerospace company struggles with parts and labor shortages.

The company will mostly make up for lost engine deliveries by the end of 2022, but some ""may drag into the first quarter"", Chief Executive Greg Hayes said at the Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) Laguna Conference.

Pratt & Whitney engines power all of Airbus SE (OTC: )'s A220 jets and about half of its A320neo aircraft, competing with GE-Safran joint venture CFM International.

The aerospace supply chain is struggling with acute labor shortages, hurting Airbus and rival Boeing (NYSE: ) Co's efforts to ramp up jet production to cater to a surge in travel. Engine makers, in particular, have also been hobbled by a shortage of structural castings.

Hayes said he sees Boeing 737 production at about 31 jets a month by the end of the year and 787 at about two a month. Raytheon (NYSE: ) is a major parts supplier to both programs.

Boeing said in July it was aiming to stabilize 737 production rate at 31 a month.

""We think 737s will be back somewhere around 42 to 48 and 787 back to probably 7 a month"" in 2025, Hayes projected.

""We are focused on driving stability and predictability into our production, and future rates will be determined by demand and supply chain readiness,"" Boeing said in a statement.

Hayes also differed with Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury on 2025 production rates.

""If you take a look at the projections for Airbus, we think that Airbus by 2025 will be at rate 65. And Guil might say rate 75, but we think rate 65 is doable."" Hayes said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - General Electric (NYSE: ) Co is still grappling with supply-chain bottlenecks which have made it tougher to deliver products to customers on time, Chief Financial Officer Carolina Dybeck Happe said on Thursday.

All the businesses of the Boston-based industrial conglomerate have been facing challenges in satisfying customer demand due to shortages of parts, labor and raw materials.

In the second quarter, supply-chain and macroeconomic pressures shaved off 5 percentage points from GE's revenue.

Dybeck Happe told a Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) conference those factors continue to impact output of its jet engines and healthcare products.

""Supply chain continues to be tough and continues to impair our ability to deliver to our customers,"" she said.

As a result, she said the company's cash flow is expected to be under pressure. She expects GE's free cash flow in the quarter through September to be either in line or slightly better than the June quarter.

The company reported $162 million in free cash flow in the second quarter.

GE's shares were down 3.9% at $66.2 in extended trading.

To be sure, manufacturers of all shapes and sizes have been struggling to produce enough for current demand and restock inventory after the COVID-19 pandemic fractured global supply chains. The pain, however, is more acute in the aerospace industry.

On Wednesday, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) warned delivery of some of its Pratt & Whitney large commercial engines may slip into the first quarter.

Dybeck Happe said GE expects a mid-single-digit revenue growth in the third quarter.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/general-electric-deliveries-still-affected-by-supplychain-issues-2893287,0.057,0.858,0.084,0.8722

BEIJING (Reuters) - China will impose sanctions on the chief executives of Boeing (NYSE: ) Defense and Raytheon (NYSE: ) over their involvement in Washington's latest arms sales to Taiwan, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Friday.

The sanctions on Boeing Defense, Space, and Security CEO Ted Colbert and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp boss Gregory Hayes are in response to the U.S. State Department approval on Sept. 2 of the sale of military equipment to Taiwan.

Those sales include 60 anti-ship missiles and 100 air-to-air missiles, of which the respective principal contractors are Boeing Defense, a division of Boeing Co , and Raytheon.

Colbert and Hayes will be sanctioned ""in order to protect China's sovereignty and security interests"" said foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning citing ""their involvement in these arms sales.""

Mao did not elaborate on what the sanctions would entail or on how they would be enforced. Neither company sells defense products to China, but both have robust commercial aviation businesses there.

U.S. defense procurement rules generally prohibit Chinese-origin content, so sanctions have had no impact on the U.S. military.

""The Chinese side once again urges the U.S. government and relevant entities to... stop selling arms to Taiwan and U.S.-Taiwan military contacts.""

The Pentagon announced the package in the wake of China's aggressive military drills around Taiwan following a visit last month by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking U.S. official to travel to Taipei in years.

China has previously sanctioned Raytheon, Boeing Defense, and unspecified individuals involved in arms sales to Taiwan.

A Raytheon spokesman declined to comment. Boeing declined to comment immediately, but on Thursday said it plans to remarket some airplanes that it had earmarked for Chinese airlines as geopolitical tensions have delayed deliveries.

In December 2021, China approved the return of Boeing's 737 MAX to service after it had been grounded following two accidents involving the airliner that killed 346 people.

Despite the approval, Chinese airlines have not resumed flying the MAX and have not accepted deliveries of new MAX aircraft. The U.S. government has previously accused the Chinese government of blocking tens of billions of dollars of MAX deliveries to China.

Before the MAX was grounded, Boeing was selling a quarter of the planes it built annually to Chinese buyers, its largest customers.

Raytheon sells to China through its United Technologies engine business.

Friday's announcement marks the first time Beijing identified and imposed sanctions against individuals from these companies.

Beijing considers the self-ruled island of Taiwan a wayward province it has vowed to bring under control, by force if necessary.

President Vladimir Putin of Russia released a national address early Wednesday, ordering a ""partial"" mobilization of additional troops and effectively doubling down on his commitment to Russia’s ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

In what would be the country’s first mobilization since World War II, Putin called up additional 300,000 soldiers and reiterated his aggressive stance against Ukraine and its Western allies, claiming Russia is fighting against the ""collective West.""

Putin further fueled speculations over his potential use of nuclear weapons, saying Russia is ready to use all means at its disposal to protect the country, its people, and the territories it claims, adding ""This is not a bluff.""

During the address, Putin also voiced his support for recently announced referendums in occupied territories – multiple Russian-controlled areas have scheduled votes on breaking away from Ukraine and joining Russia.

The move, widely criticized in the West, follows a string of Ukraine’s recent battlefield advances – in early September, the country launched a counteroffensive operation, re-capturing multiple major cities in Russian-occupied territories, and ""freeing"" over 6,000 square kilometers of its territory, according to President Vladimir Zelensky.

The conflict escalation is once again bringing increased attention to key US military contractors – shares of Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ), Northrop Grumman (NYSE: ), Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), and General Dynamics (NYSE: ) are all recording 2-3% gains in early Wednesday trading.

Since the war began, multiple governments worldwide have committed to increase military spending, although any major deal is yet to be announced.

The strength may also be attributed to the US’s (and global) continuous military and financial support of Ukraine – just 5 days prior the US Department of State authorized additional $600M military assistance package for the struggling nation.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/this-is-not-a-bluff--russias-putin-to-mobilize-300000-more-troops-defense-names-jump-432SI-2896359,0.067,0.817,0.116,0.9268

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Pentagon on Thursday said it awarded Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) a $985 million dollar contract to develop prototypes for a hypersonic attack cruise missile, putting the firm well ahead of rivals in the race to become lead developer of the strategic weapons.

Raytheon (NYSE: ) beat out Boeing (NYSE: ) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) to continue its development of the weapon. The award is a significant advance in the development of hypersonic weapons for the United States, and puts Raytheon in an early lead for a series of related, and high-value, contract awards in the years ahead.

Hypersonic weapons travel in the upper atmosphere at speeds of about 6,200 km per hour (3,853 mph), more than five times the speed of sound.

The hypersonic attack cruise missile (HACM) is an air launched hypersonic weapon being developed in cooperation with the Australian government.

""With advanced threats emerging around the globe, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile will provide our warfighters a much-needed capability,"" said Wes Kremer, president of Raytheon Missiles & Defense.

The Air Force expects delivery in fiscal 2027.

MONTREAL/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Canada's Mitchell Aerospace has a booming business - and a shop-floor shortfall that is reverberating from Boeing (NYSE: ) to Airbus. The Montreal-based supplier of aircraft parts has an order backlog from clients such as Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), as aircraft makers push to ramp up output after a two-year slump. Like other companies that supply precision cast parts for everything from landing gear to engine components, Mitchell Aerospace is facing a labor shortage expected to hobble plane production through 2023.

""It's just a hurricane in the plant,"" said company President Guillermo Alonso. ""There's just no time. It's just produce, produce, produce and find ways to improve your productivity.""

A slowing global economy has started to unwind some supply chain shortages that hit manufacturers and contributed to inflation. Demand for shipping and airfreight have softened, chip sales are slowing and used car prices in the United States are falling.

But aircraft parts makers are still reeling from deep job cuts undertaken when planes were grounded during the pandemic, a sign of how uneven the supply chain crisis remains.

In the United States, aerospace employment is 8.4% below its pre-pandemic level. In the province of Quebec, where Mitchell is located, the industry needs to fill 38,000 jobs in the next decade, according to industry trade group Aero Montreal. Major casting makers like Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) Inc's Precision Castparts Corp and Pittsburgh-based Howmet Aerospace, which supply Boeing, Airbus and General Electric (NYSE: ), are hiring after slashing staffing in 2020. But it takes time to train new hires. Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun warned that labor will remain a bottleneck for the industry for years. ""I don't see this getting resolved any time soon,"" Calhoun told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce conference this month. The problem is most acute in the highly labor intensive, hard to automate castings industry. In a recent Jefferies survey, nearly three-fourths of aerospace equipment makers cited castings as the largest source of shortages. Privately-held Mitchell Aerospace is encouraging staff to take overtime, raising wages by 4.75%, and offering workers referral bonuses. It is also trying to hire more women, immigrants and refugees from Ukraine. Some casting suppliers are taking as much as 72 weeks to fill in orders, said David Wireman, a managing director at AlixPartners. Rising interest rates and mounting economic uncertainty are making companies wary about ramping up capacity, given concerns that demand could collapse, he said. ""It is going to be a rocky time for quite a while."" ‘IT’S ALL LABOR’ Meanwhile, the struggle to find workers is rippling through the supply chain, delaying jet engine and aircraft production at a time when much of the air travel market is booming. Leesta Industries, a Mitchell customer, is also wrestling with delays and quality problems from a different castings producer. When that producer delivers a month late, Montreal-based Leesta, which makes engine and landing gear components, must adjust to meet its own deadlines, said President Ernie Staub. ""Your actual lead time of your product has been hurt by a month. You have to be ahead on the rest of your work,"" he said. Raytheon (NYSE: ) recently said tight supplies of castings has left it operating ""hand-to-mouth,"" warning that delivery of some Pratt & Whitney large commercial engines might slip into the first quarter of 2023. The company did not specify the previous timeline for the deliveries.

Rival GE said supply shortages have made it harder to deliver engines on time. Their customers are feeling the pinch. Airbus' production target has declined, while Boeing warned supply chain pressures have capped its ability to ramp up output. Mitchell's Montreal factory starts humming before sunrise with workers in protective gear filling mold sections with a mix of fine sand and a bonding agent. The whirring and grinding stops by mid-afternoon with no workers for a second shift.

""It's all labor,"" said Alonso, who is looking for shop workers and metallurgists. ""We have the demand.""

Mitchell can only pass on about half of its higher costs to customers. Automating a part of Mitchell's sand casting production by next year could address some labor issues, higher costs and allow for growth, Alonso said.

He sees robots replacing a job in which a worker must remove debris from castings. The work is repetitive and the part is at risk of damage in the process.

""We haven't pulled the trigger on the investment yet,"" Alonso said, ""but it's a necessity.""",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/aircraft-parts-output-is-being-grounded-by-worker-shortages-2899817,0.087,0.866,0.047,-0.9818

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic members of the U.S. Congress called for a sharp reduction in military sales to Saudi Arabia, as President Joe Biden on Thursday considered how to respond to plans by OPEC+ nations to cut oil output.

OPEC+, which combines OPEC countries and allies such as Russia, agreed to steep oil production cuts on Wednesday, curbing supply in a tight market and raising the possibility of higher gasoline prices right before the Nov. 8 U.S. midterm elections, when Biden's Democrats are defending their control of the House of Representatives and Senate.

Some U.S. lawmakers have long questioned the security relationship with the Saudis, angry about the huge civilian toll in Yemen - where Saudi Arabia has led a military coalition against the Iran-aligned Houthis - as well as human rights abuses such as the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

""I think it's time for a wholesale re-evaluation of the U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia,"" Senator Chris Murphy, chairman of the Senate foreign relations subcommittee on the Middle East, told CNBC.

In the House, Representatives Tom Malinowski, Sean Casten and Susan Wild introduced legislation seeking the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Representative Ruben Gallego suggested the United States take back Patriot missile defense systems deployed in Saudi Arabia. ""If they like the Russians so much they can use their very 'reliable' military technology,"" Gallego said on Twitter.

Saudi Arabia is the largest customer for U.S.-made military equipment, with billions of dollars in orders approved by the State and Defense departments each year. In August, the Biden administration announced a sale to Saudi Arabia of Patriot missile interceptors and equipment worth up to $3.05 billion.

Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) was the prime contractor for the Patriot interceptors.

Lawmakers have the right to review major arms sales and to stop them under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976. But Congress has never been able to garner enough votes to stop a sale, including three failed efforts to override former President Donald Trump's 2019 vetos of resolutions that would have stopped sales to the Saudis.

It was not clear that the United States would be able to take back any Patriot system or other military equipment already transferred or sold to Saudi Arabia.

""As a practical matter, it is exceedingly difficult to imagine a scenario in which the President authorizes the deployment of a 'military repo force' to Saudi Arabia to recover previously sold defense articles because he disagrees with OPEC on petroleum output,"" said Franklin Turner, a government contracts lawyer at McCarter & English.

In addition, there would be ""immense logistical challenges"" associated with such an operation, Turner said, adding such an act would severely strain diplomatic relations with the Kingdom.

Biden's economic adviser Brian Deese was asked on Thursday why U.S. taxpayers should offer U.S. weaponry and defense support to Saudi Arabia in light of the OPEC+ decision.

Deese told reporters on Air Force One he had no announcements. ""As we mentioned yesterday, we will be assessing and consulting closely with Congress around a range of issues on the back end of this and beyond that,"" Deese said.",https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/us-lawmakers-question-saudi-arms-sales-as-biden-mulls-opec-response-2906707,0.069,0.878,0.053,-0.9435

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans will have the power to block aid to Ukraine if they win back control of Congress, but they are more likely to slow or pare back the flow of defense and economic assistance than stop it, analysts said.

They might also use support for the Ukrainian war effort as leverage to force Democrats to back Republican priorities such as clamping down on immigration across the southern border with Mexico.

Democrats have been raising the possibility Republicans would curb assistance to Kyiv for months, given polls showing the party likely to end the Democrats' narrow control of the House of Representatives, if not the Senate, in the Nov. 8 midterm elections. Europeans bearing the brunt of the war's impact have also voiced concern.

President Joe Biden said on Thursday during a visit to Pennsylvania - a state with close congressional races - that he was worried about the Republican stance on aid to Ukraine.

There has been more Republican opposition in the House, where the caucus is more closely allied than in the Senate with former President Donald Trump and his ""America First"" policies. All 57 House votes against a bill providing more than $40 billion for Ukraine in May came from Republicans.

""You've got big pockets of the Republican party that have very kind of isolationist views,"" said Scott Anderson, a governance expert at the Brookings Institution.

However, Anderson and other analysts said there remains widespread bipartisan support for Ukraine eight months after Russia's invasion and that is unlikely to change soon, especially if Ukrainian forces continue a recent series of battlefield advances.

Anderson said some Republicans have viewed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's administration as corrupt since Trump's first impeachment trial.

House Democrats voted to impeach Trump in 2019 on charges he held up military aid for Kyiv to put pressure on Zelenskiy to investigate one of Biden's sons. The issue could loom large again for Trump's closest House allies, especially if he becomes the Republican presidential nominee in 2024.

""They're a minority element (but) that doesn't mean they won't wield potentially outsized influence in the Republican caucus,"" Anderson said.

Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, chided Republicans who have questioned supporting Ukraine, condemning what he termed ""apologists"" for Russian President Vladimir Putin and warning against ""unprincipled populism"" during a speech on Wednesday at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

Conservative U.S. television personalities who wield a major influence over the Republican base have also inveighed against assistance approved for Kyiv, which totals about $66 billion so far including military, economic and humanitarian support.

""It is certainly a question that looms large over Capitol Hill at the moment,"" said Brett Bruen, who was director of global engagement in President Barack Obama's White House.

NO 'BLANK CHECK'

Concern about a Republican-led shift in policy on Kyiv was amplified this week when Representative Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican and likely next Speaker, said there would be no ""blank check"" for Ukraine if Republicans take over.

""I think people are going to be sitting in a recession and they're not going to write a blank check to Ukraine,"" McCarthy told Punchbowl News. ""And then there's the things [the Biden administration] is not doing domestically. Not doing the border and people begin to weigh that.""

In an appearance on Bloomberg Television, Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said some in his party are concerned about the cost of the Ukraine effort but not the goal, and he pledged ""more oversight and accountability"" if Republicans win the majority.

Biden administration officials have said they will support Ukraine's fight against Russia for as long as necessary.

Mark Cancian, a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the total U.S. price tag for the Ukraine war is relatively small, given the Pentagon's $800 billion annual budget and the importance of supporting democracy and stability in Europe.

""Many strategists - and I would put myself among them - would say this is a reasonable amount of money and it's cost-effective,"" he said, noting the price would be much higher if U.S. troops were doing the fighting.

Several defense industry executives said they viewed the Republican comments on Ukraine aid as political rhetoric ahead of the midterms, not a threat.

Shares of companies including Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ), General Dynamics Corp (NYSE: )., L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: ), Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE: ) have outperformed major stock market indexes so far this year.

Polls have Americans backing the aid. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion survey this month showed 73% of Americans felt the United States should continue to support Kyiv. There was more support among Biden's fellow Democrats - 81% - than Republicans - 66%.

The possibility of less U.S. military assistance has prompted jitters in Ukraine itself and elsewhere in Europe.

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

A massive week for top technology firms worldwide pits U.S. mega cap earnings against the withering slide in China tech shares amid domestic political and economic fears.

Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) report earnings after the bell on Tuesday, with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Meta and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) completing updates later in the week from the group of five huge tech companies that collectively make up a fifth of the market cap of the .

Microsoft is set to post its slowest quarterly revenue growth in over five years, with some doubts about its outlook in the face of PC market slowdowns and a strong dollar.

But the decimation of Chinese tech stocks this week was more worrying. There was no bounce in Hong Kong stocks on Tuesday after they plunged more than 6% in the previous session as President Xi Jinping introduced the new Politburo Standing Committee stacked with loyalists.

also extended its decline to a near 15-year low as Chinese assets continued to slide amid investor concerns about Beijing's policy direction, forcing the country's foreign exchange regulator to survey banks about their positioning in the currency market.

U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies such as Pinduoduo (NASDAQ: ), JD (NASDAQ: ).com and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ: ) plunged between 12% and 25% in New York on Monday. And JPMorgan (NYSE: ) chief Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday that fractious geopolitics right now were even more concerning than a possibility of a U.S. recession.

Gloomy soundings about China's economy also weighed, with high-frequency readouts on travel, shipping, consumption and commerce in the world's second-largest economy showing an early speed bump in the fourth quarter as COVID curbs bite.

HSBC's shares fell almost 7% in London, meantime, as investors digested a sudden management change and rising bad loan charges. HSBC named Georges Elhedery as its new chief financial officer on Tuesday in a surprise shift that puts the former head of its investment bank in pole position to eventually succeed Noel Quinn as chief executive.

The change came as HSBC reported a 42% slide in third quarter profit, hit by loan losses and charges from the sale of its French business as it seeks to placate investors including its largest, China's Ping An Insurance Group.

The move contrasted with the 5% surge in UBS shares after the Swiss bank logged a smaller-than-expected 24% slide in quarterly net profit amid robust client inflows, lower costs and financial trading that helped offset a hit to investment banking from this year's market volatility.

Some calm returns to British markets more generally as former finance minister Rishi Sunak becomes British prime minister on Tuesday and sets about tackling a mounting economic problems with a new cabinet and a fresh budget plan on Oct 31.

Long-dated UK government bond yields at the center of the firestorm caused by last month's botched mini-budget have almost returned to where they were before the release of the fiscal plan on Sept. 23. The expected peak Bank of England interest rate next year slipped back below 5%.

As investors awaited the European Central Bank's latest interest rate rise on Thursday, German business readings were above forecast for October. But Germany's Ifo research institute said it saw a 'winter recession' coming and the ECB's latest survey showed euro zone banks expect to tighten access to credit further in the fourth quarter.

Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:

* U.S. Oct consumer confidence, Richmond Fed Oct business surveys, Philadelphia Fed Oct non-manufacturing index. U.S. Aug House prices

* U.S. Treasury auctions 2-year notes

WALLOPS ISLAND, Va. (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy and Army blasted off a rocket from a seaside launch pad in Virginia to test nearly a dozen hypersonic weapon experiments on Wednesday to help develop the new class of weapon, the Pentagon said, calling the test successful.

Sandia National Laboratories ran the test from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, which evaluated hypersonic weapon communications and navigation equipment as well as advanced materials that can withstand the heat in a ""realistic hypersonic environment,"" according to a Navy statement.

Hypersonic glide vehicles are launched from a rocket in the upper atmosphere before gliding to a target at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 3,853 miles (6,200 km) per hour.

The United States and its global rivals have quickened their pace to build hypersonic weapons - the next generation of arms that rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms.

To speed the development the Pentagon launched these experiments and prototypes using a sounding rocket, a smaller and therefore more affordable test vehicle, to fill a critical gap between ground testing and full-system flight testing.

Wednesday's test was intended to validate future aspects of the Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) and the Army's Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW).

Glide bodies are different from their air-breathing hypersonic weapon cousins, which use scramjet engine technology and the vehicle's high speed to forcibly compress incoming air before combustion to enable sustained flight at hypersonic speeds.

Companies such as Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp are working to develop U.S. hypersonic weapon capability.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/pentagon-successfully-flight-tests-hypersonic-weapon-components-2922635,0.092,0.846,0.061,-0.8225

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Pentagon leaders plan to meet with defense industry executives next week to discuss ways to tackle supply-chain problems, a U.S. official told Reuters, amid an expected surge in demand for weapons from U.S. allies due to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Deputy Secretary of Defense Kath Hicks will host a classified meeting with top U.S. defense contractors to discuss the National Defense Strategy, securing supply chains and shoring up the defense industrial base, including workforce challenges, spokesperson Eric Pahon told Reuters earlier this week.

Concern among Pentagon officials is growing that top U.S. defense suppliers will struggle with a surge in orders for weapons from European nations like Germany and Poland, amid growing fears of Russian President Vladimir Putin's ambitions in the region.

Prior meetings between Pentagon officials and top arms makers including Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ), Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE: ) were focused on Ukraine and hypersonic weapon development.

Despite global interest in weapons, major U.S. arms makers continue to cite a tight labor market and lingering supply-chain problems from the coronavirus pandemic to tamp down expectations about how quickly they will be able to deliver on those expected orders.

""We have heard the concerns from industry regarding supply-chain challenges and workforce issues – and we share them,"" the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer Bill LaPlante told Reuters in a statement.

Pandemic related supply-chain issues are still hurting defense contractors because components and materials fail to arrive on time, which delays production and ultimately payment.

The Pentagon plans $500 million in workforce training and retention programs coupled with over $2 billion in supply-chain investments in the coming years as part of an effort to tackle the problems.

But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted countries like the United States and Germany to raise their defense spending budgets to record levels.

THE LONGEST POLE

In the meantime, the defense industry is taking steps on its own to shore up supplies and labor.

""If I had to boil it down to the longest pole in the tent, it's the labor issues that are pervasive throughout the supply chain,"" Raytheon (NYSE: ) Chief Financial Officer Neil Mitchill told Reuters.

Raytheon's head, Greg Hayes, told investors last week the company had deployed teams to work with 400 problematic suppliers ""on a daily basis, getting them raw material, giving them contract labor, giving them technical support.""

Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE: )'s Chief Financial Officer Dave Keffer told Reuters the company had ""added a lot of resources and focus on hiring,"" with net new hires of 2,700 in the third quarter alone.

Last month, Lockheed head Jim Taiclet, told investors the company was ""cross-training"" employees to allow them to shift between product lines as demand grows and changes in the coming years.

Demand is real. Last month, Poland agreed to buy 288 artillery rocket launchers from South Korea, although it has said it wants many more.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pentagon-us-arms-makers-to-meet-on-labor-and-supply-chain-2932482,0.061,0.857,0.082,0.6715

(Reuters) - U.S. aerospace giant Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp said on Tuesday stability in supply of castings, used in making engines, may only happen well into next year after a strong recovery in aftermarket sales put further pressure on a battered supply chain.

""I think we expect that (castings supply) to take the rest of this year and into probably through most of next year to stabilize and get back kind of to the levels where we need to see it,"" Raytheon (NYSE: ) finance chief Neil Mitchill said.

Raytheon, a supplier to planemakers Boeing (NYSE: ) Co and Airbus SE (OTC: ), is working with vendors to find alternative ways to test and qualify materials and help them get parts out of their doors faster, Mitchill said at a Baird conference.

Supply shortages have crippled aerospace's ability to meet a snapback in demand for travel. The supply of castings has been singled out as problematic by aerospace executives as manufacturing them is a labor-intensive process and it takes time to train new hires.

Shortages are now prompting Raytheon to choose between making new engines and servicing old ones.

""We are continuing to support our OE (original equipment) customers as well as making the appropriate trade-offs between our aftermarket needs and delivering for new aircraft,"" Mitchill added.

TRAVEL DEMAND A 'WATCH ITEM'

Raytheon, whose Pratt & Whitney engines power all of Airbus' A220 jets and about half of the A320neo aircraft, said it had not seen any signs of travel demand, which has turbocharged the industry's recovery, subsiding.

""There is so much pent-up demand, and we're just not seeing any signals yet in our business that it's going to slow down,"" Mitchill said, mirroring comments made by major U.S. airlines in recent weeks.

However, he added travel demand remains a ""watch item"", amid recessionary fears.

(Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate General Electric (NYSE: ) Co and defense contractor L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: ) Inc are among those competing to acquire rocket maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE: ) Inc, according to people familiar with the matter.

Aircraft producer Textron Inc (NYSE: ) and private equity firm Veritas Capital are also vying to acquire El Segundo, California-based Aerojet, which has a market value of about $4 billion, the sources said.

Aerojet has been running a process to sell itself after its $4.4 billion sale to Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) was thwarted by antitrust regulators in February, Reuters has previously reported. If the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be inked by the end of December, the sources added, cautioning that no agreement was certain.

Aerojet does not see in the line-up of bidders the antitrust issues that led to the demise of its deal with Lockheed, because none of the suitors are direct competitors or share much of the same supply chain, one of the sources said.

The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential.

""We regularly assess multiple options as we pursue game-changing solutions for our customers,"" an L3 Harris spokesperson said, declining to comment specifically on the company's pursuit of Aerojet. Spokespeople for Aerojet, General Electric, Textron and Veritas Capital did not respond to requests for comment.

Aerojet develops and manufactures liquid and solid rocket propulsion and hypersonic engines for space, defense, civil and commercial applications. Its customers include the Pentagon, Boeing (NYSE: ), Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp.

L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) were reinstated at Neutral by Citi analysts in a research note on aerospace and defense-related stocks on Thursday.

The analysts assigned L3Harris a $250 per share price target, saying the firm views the company as a ""well-diversified competitor"" with strengths in defense electronics and communication across all domains, including air, sea, land, and space.

However, while they are constructive on the outlook for the company and its defense end markets over the long term, Citi is concerned nearer-term about growth and margin rates relative to investor expectations.

""We would become more positive on shares should the company sign a delayed international award, work through its supply chain constraints more quickly than expected, and / or manage its cost structure in way that allows for current margin rates to either hold or expand. We would become less constructive on shares should the company experience prolong supply chain issues and / or if it is not successful in aligning its cost structure with the prices it can charge for its products,"" explained the analysts.

For Raytheon, the analysts assigned a $104 price target on the stock, providing similar reasons on their view of the company. These include it being a ""well-diversified competitor"" across both commercial and defense markets with ""strengths in technology development and engineering that are used to design a broad portfolio of defense and commercial electronics and platforms across all domains, including air, sea, land and space.""

""We are constructive on the outlook for the company and both its commercial and defense end markets over the long-term and our estimates reflect the company's ability to garner its historic share of future customer work,"" added the analysts.

""That said, our estimates also include ramping production of new commercial aircraft to levels articulated by major customers, as well as an acceleration of retirements of older models. In our view, this combination could dampen the company's ability to expand margins to the level expected by investors and to the levels set out in the company's longer-term targets.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is preparing to send Ukraine a $275 million military aid package offering new capabilities to defeat drones and strengthen air defenses, according to a document seen by Reuters on Thursday and people familiar with the package.

The package could be announced as early as Friday. Details of the anti-drone and air defense equipment included could not be determined.

The Pentagon is also expected to include rockets for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers made by Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ), 155mm ammunition, Humvee military vehicles and generators, according to the people and the document.

A National Security Council spokesperson declined to comment on the aid package. The contents and size of aid packages can shift until they are signed by the president.

The $275 million will be covered by Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) which allows the United States to transfer defense articles and services from stocks quickly without congressional approval in response to an emergency.

Russia's surge in missile strikes in Ukraine is partly designed to exhaust Kyiv's supplies of air defenses and achieve dominance of the skies above the country, a senior Pentagon official said in November.

To counter these attacks, the United States has sent sophisticated anti-aircraft NASAMS systems to Ukraine which have been running for a few weeks.

Washington previously announced it was sending four Avenger short-range air defense systems that use Stinger missiles, made by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, and HAWK interceptor missiles.

U.S. allies have also been sending air defense systems.

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"", the United States has sent around $19.1 billion worth of security assistance to Kyiv.

U.S. lawmakers voted on Thursday to provide Ukraine at least $800 million in additional security assistance next year.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-to-send-ukraine-antidrone-air-defense-aid-worth-275-million-2960562,0.048,0.839,0.113,0.9507

The company guided to at least $2.5BB of shares repurchased in 2022E and $3.0BB in 2023,"" wrote the analysts. ""Since 2020, RTX has repurchased $6.8BB of shares as of Q3:22, driving the average diluted share count down 47.8MM shares from 1,525MM at MoE close.""

The analysts, who maintained a Buy rating and $100 per share price target on the stock, added: ""RTX has set a target to return $20BB+ of capital to shareholders in the first four years following MoE close (Apr 2020). To date, the company has returned $14.8BB to shareholders through the dividend ($8.8BB or 105% of FCF) and share repurchase ($6.0BB or 71% of FCF). This implies an incremental $5.2BB returned to shareholders through Q1:24 with our estimate incorporating upside to the target with $7.3BB deployed during Q4:22 and 2023.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's visit to Washington on Wednesday, the Biden administration said it would provide another $1.85 billion in military aid to Ukraine, including the Patriot air defense system that the Ukrainian leader has said his country urgently needs to fend off Russian attacks.

Here's what you need to know about the Patriot:

WHAT IS THE PATRIOT SYSTEM?

The Patriot, which stands for Phased Array Tracking Radar for Intercept on Target (NYSE: ), is a theater-wide surface-to-air missile defense system built by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp and considered one of the most advanced air defense systems in the U.S. arsenal.

The system was first used in combat during the 1991 Gulf War, with batteries protecting Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel, and later used during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.

It is a mobile system that usually includes powerful radar, a control station, a power generator, launch stations and other support vehicles.

The system has different capabilities depending on the type of interceptor used.

The PAC-2 interceptor uses a blast-fragmentation warhead, while the newer PAC-3 missile uses more advanced hit-to-kill technology.

The system's radar has a range of over 150 km (93 miles), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) said in 2015.

WHAT DOES IT COST?

A newly produced single Patriot battery costs over $1 billion, with $400 million for the system and $690 million for the missiles in a battery, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.

HOW WIDELY IS THE SYSTEM USED?

Raytheon (NYSE: ) has built more 240 Patriot systems and they are currently used by 18 countries, including the United States. The system has been in high demand in the Middle East because of the threat posed by Iran to the region.

According to Raytheon, the system has intercepted more than 150 ballistic missiles in combat since 2015.

HOW WOULD IT HELP UKRAINE?

Ukraine has said it needs more air defense systems to protect against the barrage of missile and drones strikes from Russian forces.

So far, the United States has provided a pair of National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) to Ukraine.

While the Patriot system is designed to intercept threats like aircraft and ballistic missiles, it can also shoot down the ""kamikaze"" drones Russia has frequently sent to hit Ukrainian critical infrastructure. But it would be an extremely expensive way to destroy drones that only cost thousands of dollars.

Officials and experts have said that while the Patriot system is likely to save lives from incoming missiles, it probably won't change the trajectory of the nearly 10-month conflict since it is a defensive system.

WHEN WILL IT ARRIVE IN UKRAINE?

It will be several months before Ukraine can deploy the Patriot on the battlefield.

U.S. officials have told Reuters that the Patriot system will first arrive in Germany, where Ukrainian troops will learn how to use them.

The training can take months, with each system requiring dozens of troops to operate.

Ukraine will then have to decide how and where to deploy the system without it being destroyed by Russian forces. Russia has said the Patriot missile defense system would be a legitimate target for Russian strikes.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/explainerwhat-is-the-patriot-missile-defense-system-2968809,0.053,0.889,0.058,-0.6817

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new U.S. weapons aid package for Ukraine worth more than $3 billion is set to be announced later on Friday and will include Sea Sparrow missiles for air defense and Bradley Fighting Vehicles, according to a document seen by Reuters.

The Sea Sparrow missiles will help curb Russian missile strikes on Ukraine, which are intended to exhaust Kyiv's air defenses and damage the country's energy infrastructure.

The U.S. and Germany have also pledged to send Patriot missile systems to repel Russian missile and drone attacks.

The RIM-7 Sea Sparrow will be an additional anti-air defense system for Ukraine. It is currently in production by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE: ).

The armored Bradley Fighting Vehicle has a powerful gun and has been used regularly by the U.S. Army to carry troops around battlefields since the mid-1980s. The Army has thousands of Bradleys. The United States plans to send about 50.

Politico reported on Thursday that the Sea Sparrow System would be used on the Buk launcher, a Soviet-era weapon that Ukraine currently uses.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-to-unveil-over-3-billion-in-ukraine-aid-with-new-air-defense-missiles-2975166,0.108,0.807,0.085,-0.7906

Goldman Sachs downgraded aerospace and defense stocks Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE: ) to Sell in a note Friday, also cutting Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) to Neutral.

Goldman analysts said defense stocks now price in the potential for a new global geopolitical superpower struggle, but they do not price in the potential for a renewed focus on US government cumulative debt.

""The former may occur, but the latter may happen first; while defense budgets, company earnings, and valuations are all near all-time highs, creating more downside than upside risk, and leaving stock prices vulnerable to a medium-term de-rating,"" they wrote.

On the DoD budget, the analysts said it moves in decade-long cycles, and over time, DoD investment spending is up 70% in the last 8 years cumulatively.

""It's at an all time high in nominal absolute dollars and near peak levels in real dollars,"" said the analysts. ""Mathematically, maintaining a high growth rate is hard, declining slightly is easy.

(Reuters) - Defense companies are expected to post higher fourth-quarter sales, according to analysts, bolstered by easing supply chain bottlenecks and increased defense outlays as the Pentagon and its allies step up spending to aid Ukraine in its conflict against Russia.

However, Republican Kevin McCarthy's election as the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and his promise to curb spending have clouded the near-term outlook for weapon makers, analysts have said.

A slew of analysts has cut price targets on defense contractors since the beginning of the year, with some flagging a risk to defense outlay after House Republicans won a thin majority in the mid-term elections.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: )' Noah Poponak in a note about the defense budget over the past few years said, ""mathematically maintaining a high growth rate is hard, and declining slightly is easy"".

""U.S. fiscal policy could increasingly become a downward pressure given the significant increase in the deficit post-pandemic and recent political developments with increased pressure,"" Poponak said, adding that ""there are geopolitical upward pressures"" as well.

THE CONTEXT Defense stocks have benefited from higher outlay on weapons by the United States and its allies due to the Ukraine war, but companies have struggled with supply snags, higher costs and labor shortages.

A cut to the defense budget would negatively impact prime defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ), Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, General Dynamics Corp (NYSE: ) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE: ), which rely on the government for a huge chunk of their revenue.

""Defense Q4's look solid but DoD budget debate overhang"" is a headwind, Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr said.

Lockheed and Raytheon (NYSE: ) kick off fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 24, with General Dynamics and Northrop set to report later in the week.

Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) shares slipped slightly premarket after it reported results for its latest quarter, topping earnings estimates but missing revenue expectations.

The aerospace and defense firm reported fourth-quarter of $1.27 per share, $0.03 better than the analyst estimate of $1.24, while revenue for the quarter came in at $18.09 billion versus the consensus estimate of $18.19B.

""Raytheon Technologies delivered solid full-year results with strong free cash flow that exceeded our expectations,"" said Raytheon Technologies chairman and CEO Greg Hayes.

Looking forward, the company sees full-year 2023 sales between $72B and $73B, with adjusted earnings per share from $4.90 to $5.05.

""Our portfolio is well positioned to capture growing demand and we expect to deliver sales growth and margin expansion, along with strong free cash flow generation, in 2023,"" added Hayes.

The company also announced that it plans to realign its business units. There will be three business segments, including Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, and Raytheon, with Raytheon stating it plans to implement the reorganization during the second half of 2023.

Christopher Calio, whose role will expand to president and chief operating officer effective March 1, will oversee Raytheon's business transformation initiative.

""In 2023 we will further align our market-leading franchises with customer needs to drive operational agility and excellence,"" said Calio.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan plans to bulk-order Tomahawk cruise missiles from the United States by March next year as it begins a rapid military build-up, Minister of Defense Yasukazu Hamada said on Tuesday.

Japan wants to conclude a contract during the next financial year, which begins April 1, to buy Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp Tomahawks through the U.S. government's foreign military sales (FMS) programme, Hamada said at a regular news briefing.

Japan's latest defence budget, which will jump by a quarter from last year, includes $1.6 billion to buy the cruise missiles, part of its biggest military build-up since World War Two. The government hasn't said how many it will buy, but local media reports said it wants as many as 500.

Japan wants the cruise missile to give its military the capability to strike targets far from Japan to deter potential adversaries, including China, from attacking. The ship-launched version of the munition, which can fly more than 1,000 kilometres, would have enough range to hit targets inside China.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/japan-plans-to-bulk-order-us-tomahawk-missiles-by-march-next-year-3002300,0.048,0.913,0.039,-0.7311

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.

If U.S. consumers are the significant engine of global growth, then their roaring start to this year is zapping recession fears and investors appear happy for now that will trump any related rethink on higher borrowing costs.

Jumping 3% at almost twice the pace expected, retail sales increased by the most in nearly two years in January as households seemingly shrugged off rising prices and soaring borrowing costs.

While there were some questions about seasonal adjustments in the data, economists were impressed that sales growth was pretty broad based and have scrambled to re-crunch first quarter U.S. output forecasts as a result.

JPMorgan (NYSE: ) doubled its first-quarter GDP growth forecast to a 2% annualized rate - only a modest slowdown from the 2.9% rate in the last three months of 2022 - and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) lifted its tracking estimate by 0.6 percentage point to 1.4%.

And it's not just consumption. Production at U.S. factories rebounded 1.0% in January too, while surveys showed business conditions in New York state improving sharply in February.

There may be a more mixed picture from Thursday's data slate on producer prices, housing starts and weekly jobless claims.

But one the most remarkable aspect of this week's economic readouts is that the related hawkishness from the Federal Reserve on inflation and interest rates has not bowled over the stock market - in stark contrast to how equities greeted rising rate projections last year.

Can a stronger economy now take higher rates more comfortably? Even though rates futures and Treasury yields ticked back a bit today, pricing now has Fed policy rates moving as high as 5.25% and staying above 5% all year.

And while full-year earnings growth estimates for companies have sunk to zero, consensus forecasts are now pencilling in a rebound of almost 12% next year.

For all the turbulence in borrowing markets, the of implied volatility remains subdued below long-term averages.

U.S. stock futures are flat going into Thursday's open and European and Asia stocks were up smartly. The dollar edged back a bit but remains almost 3% up on the low of early February.

That relative serenity comes even with the U.S. debt ceiling row brewing in the background.

The Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday said the U.S. Treasury Department will exhaust its ability to pay all its bills sometime between July and September, unless the current $31.4 trillion cap on borrowing is raised or suspended.

Uncertainty about the pace of growth and annual tax receipts in April makes it difficult for government officials to predict the exact ""X-date"", it said.

Overseas, the gloom surrounding Britain's economy was not reflected in the record run in its leading blue-chip stock index.

The UK's export, banking and commodity-heavy rose to another record high above 8,000 points, underpinned by corporate earnings from Centrica (OTC: ) and Standard Chartered (OTC: ). Shares of Centrica jumped to top the FTSE 100, adding 4.2%, after the British gas owner's annual profit more than tripled and as it announced an extension of its share buyback programme.

Standard Chartered also jumped as it raised its performance goals, unveiled a new $1 billion share buyback and produced a 28% rise in annual profit as global interest rates rise. StanChart said almost half its 10% income growth came from interest.

For inflation-watchers, the world's biggest food group Nestle said it will push through further price increases this year after more expensive ingredients contributed to lower 2022 profits. ""Our gross margin is down about 260 basis points - that is massive,"" said Chief Executive Mark Schneider.

Planemaker Airbus gained 2.9% as the company targeted 2023 jet deliveries in line with its original estimate for last year.

And in the tense geopolitics between Washington and Beijing, China's commerce ministry on Thursday said it put Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) onto an ""unreliable entities list"" over arms sales to Taiwan.

Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - European demand for U.S. weaponry is soaring, but instead of big-ticket items like jets and tanks, shopping lists are focused on cheaper, less-sophisticated items such as shoulder-fired missiles, artillery, and drones that have proven critical to Ukraine's war efforts.

Countries close to Russia like Poland, Finland and Germany are striking deals to build U.S. weapons in Europe, negotiating new deals to buy arms and looking to speed up existing contracts, according to interviews with military officials and industry executives, and a Reuters review of recent announcements by governments and defense manufacturers. Demand is centered around basic weapons and munitions: 155-millimeter artillery rounds, air defenses, communications equipment, shoulder-fired Javelin missiles and drones, nearly a dozen European military attachés in Washington told Reuters in a series of recent interviews.

The focus on high-volume, less costly weapons underscores how the war in Ukraine has reshaped strategic thinking in European capitals about how future conflicts could be fought.

Visions of high-tech wars more reliant on computers and machines have been replaced by the reality of relentless artillery duels and soldiers dug into muddy trenches. The one-year-old war has seen both sides expend vast quantities of artillery shells and missiles.

Ukraine's high usage rates of ""both precision and unguided munitions have shown NATO countries that any future war would require much higher stocks than anticipated,"" said Roman Schweizer, a defense policy analyst at investment bank Cowen & Co.

The attaches said their governments were particularly keen on buying Javelins after seeing the weapon's effectiveness in Ukraine. The missiles have proven deadly against Russian tanks.

Five European countries, meanwhile, have expressed interest in buying Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: )' precision-guided 155 millimeter artillery rounds, according to a company spokesperson, who declined to name them. The rounds are accurate to within 12 feet (4 meters) and have a range of 20 miles (32 km).

The interest from the five countries has not been previously reported. The company already sells to three other European nations.

Expressions of interest are the first step in a multi-step acquisition process that includes approval from the United States government and negotiations between the buyer and weapons contractor. It can be a year or more before a weapon is actually delivered.

Several of the military attachés, who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media on behalf of their governments, said their countries have been making sure payments to defense contractors have been on schedule, hoping to forestall any delays. The weapons purchases are now a domestic policy priority in their countries, they said.

U.S. arms makers have in the past complained about late customer payments on calls with investors.

DRONES BIG AND SMALL

Small drones and bigger unmanned aircraft, which cost about $20 million each without sophisticated sensors, cameras and other ""extras,"" have also appeared on shopping lists.

Finland and Denmark began talks with General Atomics after Russia invaded Ukraine last February, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters. They want to buy a small number of MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones that can be used for maritime and land surveillance.

A Finnish defense ministry spokesperson declined to comment. A Danish defense ministry spokesperson said they have begun the process to buy at least two ""long range, long endurance Remotely Piloted Aircraft System(s)"" to strengthen ""military capacities in the Arctic,"" without naming any companies.

Poland, which has been eager to get its hands on the same model drones, just received two of the previous generation model on lease from General Atomics until they get U.S. approval to buy the new ones, according to two sources familiar with the situation.

Defense minister Mariusz Blaszczak confirmed the delivery, although not the number, in a Feb. 12 tweet that said they will be used to surveil the country's eastern border, which it shares with Ukraine and Russian ally Belarus.

Some European countries are also keen to begin producing U.S. weapons on their soil because it would reduce dependency on foreign imports and lower purchasing costs.

In Germany, arms maker Rheinmetall is ready to boost the output of tank and artillery munitions and may start producing High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) mobile rocket launchers, which have had great success targeting Russian positions, CEO Armin Papperger told Reuters.

The system is currently produced by Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) in Camden, Arkansas. It is not clear whether the system would be produced under license, a joint venture or some other arrangement.

A Lockheed Martin spokesperson declined to comment directly on the possibility of Rheinmetall beginning production of HIMARS. Lockheed Martin's Eastern European business development manager for several missile programs, Rita Flaherty, said the company was ""exploring co-production and technology transfer with several international partners.""

Latvia, too, is interested in co-producing U.S. munitions. ""We recognize the benefits provided by local production of large caliber munitions,"" military affairs spokesperson Roberts Skraucs said in a statement to Reuters.

Expectations remain high that European fears of Russian aggression will still generate orders for the biggest, multibillion dollar U.S. weapons like fighter jets and expensive missile defense systems with sophisticated radar. For more expensive arms, the first orders are expected to be used to backfill equipment sent to Ukraine by Poland. Slovakia, for example, has said it is ready to send its MiG-29 jets to Ukraine. A likely replacement would be Lockheed Martin's F-16, which cost about $65 million each.

Investors banking on soaring demand for U.S. weapons have boosted share prices of the biggest U.S. defense contractors – adding $35 billion in market value - since the invasion of Ukraine began.

ARTILLERY STILL KEY

Demand is particularly high for 155 millimeter artillery shells. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the continued importance of artillery in helping to overwhelm enemy positions or thwart troop advances. The U.S. last year shipped more than 1 million 155 millimeter shells to Ukraine, a standard round that costs the U.S. Army about $800 each.

The U.S. production goal for 155 millimeter rounds has tripled from 30,000 shells a month to 90,000 a month over the next two years, according to an Army official. The huge increase reflects the need to restock U.S. supplies as well as those of allies including Norway, Canada, Finland, France, Germany and Italy, who sent some of their stocks to Ukraine.

""It has really hit home that this is an industrial-style war,"" said Seth Jones with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, referring to a conflict that requires a high volume of weaponry in a short period of time.

Countries also realized early on in the Ukraine conflict the importance of having the Javelin anti-armor missile in their armories, which frequently appeared in news reports of Ukraine's destruction of Russian armored columns.

In April, Lithuania said it had set aside 1 billion euros for Javelins and other weapons. In May, Lockheed said it was doubling production and later in the month won, alongside its production partner Raytheon (NYSE: ), a $309 million order for more than 1,300 Javelin missiles for Norway, Albania, Latvia as well as to restock U.S. supplies sent to Ukraine. In August, the United States approved a $300 million order for Britain.

Training for Javelins is relatively quick, compared to the learning required for more sophisticated platforms like tanks and planes, and the weapons themselves are relatively inexpensive. The medium-range missiles guide themselves after being launched, allowing the shooter to take cover. A single Javelin costs the U.S. Army about $263,000.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ukraine-war-spurs-european-demand-for-us-arms-but-not-bigticket-items-3006400,0.094,0.796,0.11,0.9179

(Reuters) - Aerospace giant Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp can support a monthly production rate in the mid-50s range for Airbus SE (OTC: )'s A320 aircraft this year, a target that appears slightly below the planemaker's planned output hike.

Airbus' current output rate stands at 45 A320neo-family jets and the company plans to exit the year at a fraction below 60 a month - a rare one-third hike seen in aerospace, Reuters reported last week, citing industry sources.

Speaking at a Barclays (LON: ) conference on Wednesday, Raytheon (NYSE: ) Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes backed Airbus rival Boeing (NYSE: ) Co's planned 737 MAX jet production hike.

""There's an aspiration to get to 38 (737 MAXs) by the end of the year. We can certainly support that,"" Hayes said.

Boeing aims to raise the production of its bestselling 737 MAX jetliner from about 31 jets a month.

Production targets of the planemakers are under the scanner by investors - albeit for different reasons. Boeing is in the midst of staging a recovery from successive crises caused by two fatal crashes and the pandemic.

Airbus, on the other hand, is looking to further consolidate its position as the biggest planemaker by deliveries, but has seen its production targets pushed back by suppliers, especially by engine makers, citing supply constraints.

It was not immediately available for a comment on Wednesday.

Supply chain is getting better ""incrementally"", Raytheon CEO Hayes said, with supply of chips improving but shortfalls in castings, used in making and servicing engines, still persist.

On Pratt & Whitney's GTF engine, Hayes said their reliability has not been up to expectations and that the company was working to fix problems, amid criticism from some airlines over their performance.

By Patricia Zengerle

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration will unveil on Thursday a long-awaited overhaul of arms export policy with increased emphasis on human rights, three State Department officials familiar with the new Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) policy told Reuters.

The CAT policy covers review of security assistance, government-to-government weapons transfers and licensed commercial sales of U.S.-origin military equipment and services overseen by the State Department as well as the Defense Department and Department of Commerce, including firearms commonly available in the United States.

Defense companies and activists scrutinize such policies for insight into the administration's posture as it balances commercial interests of exporters like Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) Co and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) against the country's stated commitment to human rights.

One change is how the CAT policy addresses the possibility that arms from the United States could be used for major human rights violations, the officials said.

Under the new policy, a weapons transfer will not be approved if the State Department assesses the arms ""more likely than not"" will be used to commit or facilitate genocide, crimes against humanity, breaches of the Geneva conventions, or serious violations of international law.

Previous CAT policy had said such transfers would not be authorized only when Washington had ""actual knowledge"" that the arms would be used in such actions.

""We are looking at a policy of prevention when there is a risk of violation of human rights,"" one of the officials said.

The officials declined to specify countries that the new policy might affect.

Advocates in the past have questioned weapons sales to countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over the civilian toll of the war in Yemen.

The change could also affect exports of smaller weapons such as assault rifles and surveillance equipment that police or paramilitary forces could use against domestic populations. Some of this is under the aegis of the Commerce Department.

Reuters reported in 2021 that the Biden administration was considering such a shift. The formal unveiling was delayed by factors including the tumultuous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan in August 2021 and the war in Ukraine, which began a year ago.

It also is tied to the National Security Strategy that the Biden administration rolled out in October.

The United States is by far the world's biggest arms merchant, selling over $100 billion in weapons, services and training a year.

Members of Congress often raise rights concerns when opposing weapons transfers. For example, Senator Bob Menendez, Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, opposes the sale of Lockheed Martin F-16 aircraft to Turkey for reasons including disregard for human rights.

In 2016, Washington stopped the planned sale of some 26,000 assault rifles to the Philippines' national police force after Senator Ben Cardin, then the top Democrat on the foreign relations panel, said he would oppose it given his concerns about human rights violations during the government of the country's then-president, Rodrigo Duterte.

The new policy is a departure from that adopted in 2018 by the administration of former Republican President Donald Trump, who viewed weapons deals as a way to generate U.S. jobs and controversially cast aside the precedent for congressional review of major arms deals to push through a massive sale of smart bombs and other weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusiveus-to-vet-human-rights-more-closely-before-approving-arms-deals--officials-3011074,0.1,0.84,0.06,-0.9827

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale of anti-tank Javelin missiles to the United Kingdom for an estimated $125 million, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.

European demand for U.S. weaponry is soaring, but instead of big-ticket items like jets and tanks, shopping lists are focused on shoulder-fired missiles, artillery, and drones that have proven critical to Ukraine's war efforts. This sale to the close U.S. ally may be the first to one of many as European nations looking to restock smaller weapons that were sent to Ukraine.

The potential sale package authorized by the State Department would include 600 Javelins technical assistance, and logistics support, the Pentagon said.

The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the possible sale on Tuesday.

Despite approval by the State Department, the notification does not indicate that a contract has been signed or that negotiations have concluded.

The prime contractors will be the Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp and Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) who have a joint venture to product the tank-busting weapon, the Pentagon said.

RTX +1.03% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Pratt & Whitney, a Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) business, announced today that it has been awarded a $5.2 billion contract to support production of the 15th and 16th lots of F135 engines, with an option to award a 17th Lot, powering all three variants of the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft.

""This marks a major milestone for the program,"" said Jen Latka, Pratt & Whitney's vice president for the F135 program.

The Lots 15-17 production contract funds production of 278 F135 engines with an option to order up to a total of 518 engines. The contract also includes program management, engineering support, production support and tooling. The total contract value for lots 15-17, with exercised options, is approximately $8 billion and will fund over 418 F135 engines with options for the U.S. as well as international customers.

""This marks a major milestone for the program,"" said Jen Latka, Pratt & Whitney's vice president for the F135 program. ""This contract award enables us to continue delivering critical 5th Generation propulsion capability to the warfighter at a fair and reasonable cost for the taxpayer.""

Since program inception, Pratt & Whitney's ""war on cost"" efforts have reduced the average unit cost of an F135 by more than 50 percent, contributing to an estimated $8.1 billion in cumulative engine savings over the life of the program.

Pratt & Whitney worked aggressively to drive production efficiencies, optimize its supply base as well as invest in strategic initiatives -- such as the new turbine airfoil facility in Asheville, North Carolina -- to reduce cost wherever possible.

Evolved from the F119 engine powering the F-22 Raptor, the F135 is the most powerful and most advanced fighter engine in the world, delivering a step change in capability over the previous generation of engines. This includes a substantial increase in thermal management capacity enabling the full spectrum of F-35 weapons and sensor capabilities; a precise and responsive integrated engine control system allowing the pilot to focus squarely on the mission; and an unmatched low observable signature enabling the F-35 to conduct operations in modern Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2AD) environments.

The F135 program is a major driver of economic growth around the country, supporting more than 53,000 jobs across 36 states.

As of December 2022, Pratt & Whitney has delivered more than 1,000 F135 production engines.",https://www.investing.com/news/assorted/raytheon-technologies-announces-pratt--whitney-awarded-f135-production-contract-for-lots-1517-432SI-3023257,0.034,0.837,0.129,0.9883

CINCINNATI, Ohio (Reuters) - General Electric (NYSE: ) Co Chief Executive Larry Culp said on Thursday it was ""premature"" to talk about engine production volumes for 2025 and 2026, but dismissed speculation about a rift with planemakers on jetliner production plans.

Culp was speaking after GE said it was aligned with Boeing (NYSE: ) and Airbus on demand for LEAP jet engines through the end of 2024, adding that 2025 supplies were still being discussed as part of a standard process.

The stance of engine makers on production is widely watched because Europe's Airbus, the world's largest planemaker ahead of Boeing Co , has been struggling to win support from some suppliers for part of a record plan to increase jet output by 2026.

The end of 2024 is the cut-off point between the first phase of Airbus plans, in which output of narrow-body A320neo jets would rise to 65 a month from an estimated 45 now, and the second stage, which calls for a run-up to 75 a month in 2026.

Engine makers have, to varying degrees in the past year, voiced caution about the higher monthly target, while Airbus insists that strong demand supports the higher rate.

But Culp cautioned against reading too much into production talks as the industry focuses on pressing near-term issues.

""I think there is too much conspiracy theory and speculation going on,"" he told reporters.

""I don't think the fact that we're not talking about '25 and '26 publicly suggests anything other than it's probably at this moment premature to do so.""

Analysts say that after recent shortfalls, engine makers are anxious not to promise more than they can deliver until supply chains have returned to something closer to normal.

Financial shockwaves from the pandemic have also exposed deeper differences in the way planemakers and engine makers do business, exacerbating a tug of war between business strategies.

Even so, industry sources say engine makers have been steadily growing more comfortable with the higher production rates floated by Airbus and Boeing, following a series of airplane orders and some improvement in their supply chains.

One executive noted it is unusual for engine makers to make firm commitments to planemakers more than 18-24 months ahead.

GE's partner in engine joint-venture CFM International, France's Safran (EPA: ), has embraced plans to lift output of A320neo jets to more than 65 a month but held back from committing engine volumes for a further sprint to 75 a month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's biggest peacetime U.S. defense budget request of $886 billion includes a 5.2% pay raise for troops and the largest allocation on record for research and development, with Russia's war on Ukraine spurring demand for more spending on munitions.

Biden's request earmarks $842 billion for the Pentagon and $44 billion for defense-related programs at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Energy and other agencies. The total amount of the 2024 budget proposal is $28 billion more than last year's $858 billion.

Congress has signaled, as it often does, it will increase defense spending over Biden's request during the months-long budget process that this request kicks off. The Senate and House typically pass bills setting policy and spending levels for the Pentagon much later in the year.

Congress and the administration both have an eye on a possibly prolonged war in Ukraine and potential future conflicts with Russia and China.

""Our greatest measure of success, and the one we use around here most often, is to make sure the PRC (Peoples Republic of China) leadership wakes up every day, considers the risks of aggression, and concludes, 'today is not the day,'"" Deputy U.S. Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said on Monday.

Relations between the United States and China have become highly contentious over issues ranging from trade to espionage as increasingly the two powers compete for influence in parts of the world far from their own borders.

""This top line request serves as a useful starting point,"" U.S. Senator Jack Reed, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said when the budget figures were unveiled on Thursday.

This budget will be the first to procure missiles and other munitions with multi-year contracts, something that is routine for planes and ships, as the Pentagon signals enduring demand to top munitions makers such as Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp, Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ) and Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE: ) Inc.

The Ukraine war has shown the U.S. military it needs to make bigger lots of certain types of munitions, helping to explain the multi-year contracts for weaponry that would potentially also be used in a military conflict with China.

ADVANCED MISSILES

The budget boosts procurement of sophisticated missiles such as the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER), and the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). Those ""are for the broader strategy - for a higher end fight. They're not ground munitions,"" like those being used in Ukraine, a senior U.S. defense official said. Thus far, funds to backfill the munitions sent to Ukraine, including the JAVELIN and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), were handled by $35.7 billion in supplemental funds enacted in 2022. The Pentagon aid to Ukraine in the budget is the same as the prior year. If more funding is needed for Ukraine, the senior defense official said, another supplemental request could be drawn up. The 2024 budget boasts a historically large research and development budget for the Pentagon - $145 billion earmarked to develop new weaponry like hypersonic missiles, which are fired into the upper atmosphere and can evade even advanced radar systems. Russia has used these missiles in Ukraine.

Biden's budget request also speeds the Department of Defense's pace for buying the stealthy F-35 fighter jet to 83. The F-35 is the Pentagon's largest weapons program and will be the lynchpin of U.S. air power in the near future. The 2023 budget request asked for 61 F-35 jets made by Lockheed Martin and Congress increased that number to 77. Among the other top priorities for this budget are modernizing the U.S. nuclear ""triad"" of ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land-based missiles, shipbuilding and developing capabilities in space. The budget would benefit the biggest U.S. defense contractors including Lockheed, Raytheon (NYSE: ), Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE: ) and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE: ). Some of that investment is funded by asking to retire equipment such as two of the Navy's older Littoral Combat Ships, 32 of the Air Force's non-combat ready F-22 Raptor jet fighters and 42 older A-10 Warthogs, which the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan last year has made less essential because they are vulnerable to more sophisticated enemies.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/biden-wants-886-billion-for-defense-as-ukraine-continues-and-china-looms-3029112,0.066,0.848,0.086,0.903

They wrote in a note, “Robust air traffic recovery & heavy use of older aircraft due to delivery slips are driving healthy aftermarket demand with strong pricing and growing backlogs. Moreover, accelerating ASMs, a stabilizing supply chain, and snapback from pre-buy restrained Q4 suggest RTX's 2023 aftermarket sales gains could top its 16-20% guide. We also see healthy A/M lift in 2024 as air traffic should top 2019's baseline since real GDP is forecasted 11% above 2019.""

The DoD’s 2024 budget decision to have Pratt update the F-35, and keep it sole sourced, effectively removes the risk of a competition with for a new engine plant that could have moved into production in 2029. In addition, RMD will benefit from missile replenishment from the Ukraine war as well as U.S. weapons restocking to meet a potential Chinese threat and foreign sales to allies to meet both potential Russian threat in Europe and Chinese aggression in the Asia Pacific.

The analysts expect updated 2025 targets at the company’s investor day on June 19. The targets should remain intact ex the $1 billion Section 174 hit to RTX's $10B cash flow bogey. RTX will review revenue synergies of the sector reorganization with retroactive restatement of prior year results; and its commercial aero story should be upbeat with aftermarket now in a profit sweet spot.

TD Cowen estimates a 1Q EPS of $1.19 for RTX (compared to the Street's $1.12 estimate), which assumes a 22% commercial aftermarket sales uptick.

Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) ( RTX ) delivered all 23 contracted Joint Precision Approach and Landing Systems low-rate production units to the U.S. Navy on time or ahead of schedule.

JPALS is a software-based GPS navigation and precision approach landing system that guides aircraft onto carriers and amphibious assault ships regardless of sea state or weather conditions, bolstering safety and operational capability. It is integrated on the F-35 and was recently sold to the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force .

""This is a significant milestone for the JPALS team and highlights the incredible efforts of hundreds of our teammates over the past decade who developed and now have fully delivered these critical systems that our Warfighters and International Partners need,"" said Capt. Kevin Watkins , program manager for Naval Air Traffic Management Systems (PMA-213) at the Naval Air Systems Command. ""This team overcame many barriers over the past several years, successfully achieving the required outcome to deliver all of the capabilities needed, on time and affordably.""

""Since contract award in 2019, our team has worked closely with Naval Air Systems Command to outfit the fleet's carriers and ships with JPALS to ensure pilots can land safely and successfully anywhere in the world,"" said Mark Maselli , Raytheon Technologies' JPALS program manager. ""Their mission became our mission, and our team committed to ensure every single system was delivered to the customer on time or ahead of schedule.""

JPALS is deployed on all U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, as well as all F-35 aircraft. In addition, JPALS is deployed on two international platforms: the UK Royal Navy's HMS Queen Elizabeth , and the ITS Cavour, an Italian aircraft carrier, to support their F-35 squadrons. JPALS is expected to be deployed on the JMSDF's JS Izumo in 2024.

Raytheon has also developed an expeditionary variant of JPALS called eJPALS, which is a smaller, portable system that could be packaged in ruggedized cases, mounted on small vehicles and deployed in austere, remote locations for precision landings. The system could establish up to 50 different landing points within a 20-nautical-mile radius.",https://www.investing.com/news/assorted/raytheon-technologies-completes-delivery-of-23-joint-precision-approach-and-landing-systems-to-the-us-navy-432SI-3037982,0.026,0.898,0.076,0.9488

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of senior Democratic lawmakers will introduce legislation on Wednesday to more closely ensure that U.S. weapons sales to foreign customers do not end up contributing to or facilitating human rights abuses.

The Safeguard Act seeks to codify into law a new Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) policy introduced last month by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration to increase the emphasis on human rights concerns, according to information about the legislation seen by Reuters.

The bill is led by Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative Gregory Meeks, the ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. It has four other sponsors in the Senate and five in the House, all Democrats.

""Much like we should be requiring universal background checks before selling weapons of war domestically, we should be prioritizing a government’s human rights record before providing them access to our arms and defense services,"" Menendez said in a statement.

The CAT policy covers review of security assistance, government-to-government weapons transfers and licensed commercial sales of U.S.-origin military equipment and services overseen by the State Department as well as the Defense Department and Department of Commerce, including firearms commonly available in the United States.

Defense companies and activists scrutinize such policies for insight into the administration's posture as it balances commercial interests of exporters like Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) Co and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) against the country's stated commitment to human rights.

Under U.S. law, the chair and ranking member of the Foreign Relations and Foreign Affairs committees review major weapons transfers. They often take human rights into account and at times seek to delay or block planned sales.

For example, Menendez opposes the sale of Lockheed Martin F-16 aircraft to Turkey for reasons including its record on human rights.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-lawmakers-want-closer-link-between-foreign-weapons-sales-human-rights-3044091,0.062,0.863,0.075,-0.0314

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has awarded its largest defence equipment maker Mitsubishi Heavy Industries contracts worth 378 billion yen ($2.84 billion) to develop and build a new missile force aimed at deterring China from using military force in East Asia.

The four contracts include land, sea and air-launched missiles as well as a hypersonic ballistic warhead that it wants to begin deploying from 2026, Japan's Ministry of Defense said in a press release.

In the wake of Russia's attack on Ukraine and amid growing concern that China could launch an attack on neighbouring Taiwan, Japan in December unveiled its biggest military build-up since World War Two that will double defence spending over five years.

The new missile force, which is expected to be capable of striking ships and land targets more than 1,000 km from Japan, is at the center of that plan.

To bolster its defences before it can deploy those home-built missiles, Japan in February also said it will bulk order Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp Tomahawk cruise missiles from the United States.

It has not yet said how many it will buy, but local media reports said it will be as many as 500.

Wolfe Research analysts upgraded Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) to Outperform from Peer Perform with the price target of $117 per share, signaling an upside potential of ~17%.

The analysts believe the RTX stock is set for a rebound following a period of relative underperformance (down 1.2% year-to-date). The run-up in shares is likely to be supported by a strong aero backdrop and defense performance while the upcoming investor day could serve as a catalyst.

“RTX is hosting a 4hr investor day at the Paris Air Show that will include the roll-out of the new look and feel of the company's reporting units and include new targets and a likely reiterated $9B FCF goal for 2025 despite Street estimates that remain 10% under that bogey,” analysts said in a client note.

(Reuters) -U.S. weapons maker Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: )'s first-quarter results surpassed Wall Street targets on Tuesday despite parts and labor shortages, as simmering geopolitical tensions fueled demand from both U.S. and international customers.

Shares of the company rose as much as 3.8% to hit a record high of $508.1 in early trading.

Rising tensions in Europe, the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific region have translated to more orders for Lockheed's F-35 fighter aircraft, missiles and other defense equipments, driving quarterly net sales of $15.13 billion above estimates of $15.03 billion.

The Pentagon's $858 billion defense budget for 2023 has also resulted in multiple contract wins for U.S. defense firms such as Lockheed, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE: ), which count the U.S. Department of Defense as their biggest customer.

Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed reported GAAP earnings per share of $6.61, which included non-operational gains of $0.18 per share, and adjusted earnings of $6.43 per share for the first quarter ended March 26. Analysts were expecting profits of $6.06 per share.

During the quarter, Australia said it would buy 40 Black Hawk military helicopters made by Lockheed from the U.S. for about $1.96 billion as it boosts defense spending over issues with China's presence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Lockheed had also finalized a deal to sell 88 F-35 jets to Canada in a $14.2 billion project to replace the country's aging fleet of fighter aircraft.

Supply-chain issues stemming from the pandemic are still hurting F-35 production volumes though, pulling down sales at the company's aeronautics unit - its largest - by about 2.1% to $6.27 billion in the quarter.

Lockheed's order backlog also fell to $145.1 billion as of quarter-end from $150 billion at the end of 2022.

The missiles maker reaffirmed its full-year outlook, projecting net sales in the range of about $65 billion to $66 billion and profits between $26.60 and $26.90 per share.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lockheed-martin-results-beat-estimates-on-higher-defense-demand-3057941,0.035,0.87,0.095,0.9517

Jefferies downgraded Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) to a Hold rating (from Buy) and cut their price target on the stock to $110.00 (from $115.00) in the face of near-term profit headwinds, lack of visibility, and a steep FCF ramp reliant on op income growth.

Analysts wrote in a note, “With Collins' story well appreciated and rather solid (30% of sales/50% of segment EPS growth), we believe the biggest questions are Defense (40% of sales/25% of EPS growth) and Pratt (30% of sales/25% EPS growth). Given budget trends, Defense revs grow at a 5% CAGR in '22-'25 w/ margins up 180 bps (Ex 15). Every 50 bps of Defense margin = $0.10 to our 2025 EPS base of $6.40. At Pratt, GTF AM is biggest EBIT driver of the segment's expansion from $1.1BB in 2022 to $2.2BB in 2025. We est GTF revs grow from $1.3BB in 2022 to $3BB by 2025 (Ex 10). Assuming 40% drop-through, this is $650MM of the incremental $1.1BB of EBIT growth at P&W. Every $100MM of EBIT is worth $0.06 to EPS; put differently, every 100 bps of P&W margin is worth $0.15. If we assume 1 of 2 of the above do not improve (P&W or Defense), this could drive EPS down to ~$6.25 in 2025 vs cons of $6.78. At a market multiple of 16X, this derives $100/sh.”

Jefferies values the GTF program at $5/sh, but notes that each 200 bps of AM margin downside from a 30% baseline in '26 is worth $0.80/sh. At the run rate, each 500 bps change in the GTF AM margin is worth $0.06 of EPS.

With the RMD and RIS combination, RTX creates a single $29 billion defense segment vs $11B avg segments at the primes, which removes critical clarity from the growth profile. Raytheon has relatively underperformed with sales -3% organic in '22 and margins down 170 bps vs peers +1% and -10 bps.

Jefferies estimates that RTX generates $7.1B of FCF in '25 (consensus $8.2B). From the $4.9B base in 2022, FCF is driven by $3.2B of EBIT growth offset by a $1.3BB CAS pension headwind.

Jefferies sees risk to the 2025 updated FCF target of $9B, which represents a steep ramp from ~$4.8B expected for 2023 and is largely predicated on growing the bottom line with likely headwinds around working capital and Pratt profitability.

With the defense ramp and commercial OE ramp largely baked in, Jefferies sees limited near-term catalysts, with the current FY2 consensus FCF yield of 4.5% limiting rerating potential.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -Cash-strapped Indian airline Go First filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday, blaming ""faulty"" Pratt & Whitney engines for the grounding of about half its fleet.

The move marks the first major airline collapse in India since Jet Airways filed for bankruptcy in 2019, and underscores the fierce competition in a sector dominated by IndiGo and the recent merger of Air India and Vistara under the Tata conglomerate.

Go First's total debt to financial creditors was 65.21 billion rupees as of April 28, it said in a bankruptcy filing with the National Company Law Tribunal.

The company had not defaulted on any of those dues as of April 30, but had defaulted on payments to operational creditors, including 12.02 billion rupees to vendors and 26.60 billion rupees to aircraft lessors, it said in the filing.

In a statement, Go First said its filing followed a refusal by Pratt & Whitney, the exclusive engine supplier for the airline's Airbus A320neo aircraft fleet, to comply with an arbitration order to release spare leased engines that would have allowed the airline to return to full operations.

Grounded aircraft ""due to Pratt & Whitney's faulty engines"" ballooned from 7% of its fleet in December 2019 to 50% in December 2022, the airline said, costing it 108 billion rupees ($1.32 billion) in lost revenues and additional expenses.

Pratt & Whitney said in a statement to Reuters that it was ""committed to the success of our airline customers, and we continue to prioritize delivery schedules for all customers.""

""P&W is complying with the March 2023 arbitration ruling related to Go First. As this is now a matter of litigation, we will not comment further,"" it added.

In February, the boss of Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), which owns Pratt & Whitney, acknowledged that its GTF engines had had reliability issues.

Pratt & Whitney has also been quoted in Indian media as saying it was affected by industry-wide supply chain pressures and that it expects those to ease later this year, which would support increased output of new and overhauled engines.

Analysts have said bigger rival IndiGo has been able to withstand the impact better, thanks to its larger fleet and a deeper pocket.

Go First, owned by the Wadia Group and formerly known as GoAir, said on its website that it had cancelled flights scheduled for May 3 to May 5 due to ""operational reasons"".

""The government of India has been assisting the airline in every possible manner,"" India's Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said in a statement. ""The issue has also been taken up with the stakeholders involved.""

The collapse could boost rival airlines as the industry tries to meet a surge in post-pandemic air travel.

""The sudden disruption in operations is likely to benefit other players and increase airfares due to supply constraint,"" wrote Jinesh Joshi, a research analyst with Prabhudas Lilladher.

SURPRISE MOVE

The move took Go First's lenders by surprise, two bankers aware of the matter told Reuters.

The lenders met Go First's management a few weeks ago, but no intimation was given, one of the bankers said. Lenders will meet soon to assess the situation and decide on a future course of action, they said.

""I am a little stunned to hear of them file for bankruptcy,"" said Mark Martin, CEO at aviation consulting firm Martin Consulting LLC. ""I still feel that this might not be the end of Go First. This must be a vehicle and a means for somebody new to take over.""

Go First's problems, which forced it to delay its planned $440 million IPO in 2021, led to an erosion in its market share to 6.9% in March from 8.4% in January, latest data from the Indian aviation regulator showed.

The Wadia Group had been reported to be in talks to either sell its majority stake or completely exit its shareholding. Wadia Group did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Go First said the groundings had driven some lessors to ""repossess aircraft, draw down letters of credit and notify further withdrawal of aircraft.""

Employees were caught unaware as they heard about the halt in daily operations first from local media, according to three pilots who did not want to be named. They have been receiving their salaries with a delay for the past few months, the pilots added.

""We understand that this news is likely to be distressing, and we remain committed to offer our support to all of you during this difficult time,"" Go First later said in a email to employees.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Go Airlines (India) Ltd was granted bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, bolstering the country's fourth largest carrier's chances of getting back on its feet, but lessors have started mounting legal challenges to repossess planes.

The low-cost carrier, recently rebranded as Go First, was plunged into financial crisis this year, sparked by what it called ""faulty"" Pratt & Whitney engines that grounded about half its 54 Airbus A320neos.

The U.S. engine maker, part of Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), in a statement said Go First's allegations were ""without merit"".

In granting bankruptcy protection, the National Company Law Tribunal in New Delhi ordered a moratorium on Go First's assets and leases and appointed Abhilash Lal of Alvarez & Marsal as the interim resolution professional to take over management with immediate effect.

The resolution professional ""shall ensure that retrenchment of employees is not resorted to as a matter of course"", the tribunal's 41-page order said. Go First has a staff of around 7,000.

The bankruptcy move adds to headaches for lessors, which have filed requests with India's aviation regulator for the return of about 40 Go First planes after rental payments were missed.

India made it easier for lessors to take back planes if airlines default on payments after joining an international treaty known as the Cape Town Convention in 2008. But bankruptcy protection supersedes lessors' repossession requests.

""The next step for lessors is to approach the appellate tribunal... It will be a prolonged legal battle,"" said Ajay Kumar, managing partner at India's KLA Legal, which represents Go First lessors including Jackson Square Aviation and Bank of China Aviation.

He added that Go First's woes will lead to higher lease premiums for Indian airlines.

That could prove to be a pain point for the sector at a time when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is touting the country's emergence as an aviation powerhouse, with bigger rivals IndiGo and Tata Group's Air India expanding aggressively.

Go First's lessors also include SMBC Aviation Capital and CDB Aviation's GY Aviation Leasing.

They did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, according to a filing seen by Reuters, SBMC Aviation Capital has already approached India's appeals tribunal seeking to quash the bankruptcy order.

'HISTORIC' DECISION

Go First's voluntary pursuit of bankruptcy protection to renegotiate contracts and debt marks a first for an Indian airline. CEO Kaushik Khona, who was present as the order was read, hailed the tribunal's decision as ""historic"".

The airline, which had a 7% share of the world's third largest aviation market in March, has currently suspended all flights due to ""operational reasons"" and is not taking new bookings.

Reviving the carrier - one of the hardest hit worldwide by problems with Pratt & Whitney engines - will not be easy, said Abhirup Dasgupta, a partner at HAS Advocates who specialises in insolvency law but is not involved in Go First's proceedings.

It will require fresh funds, and lenders could be wary of investing, he said.

Go First's bankruptcy filing lists Central Bank of India Ltd, Bank of Baroda Ltd, IDBI Bank Ltd, and Deutsche Bank (ETR: ) among financial creditors which are owed 65.21 billion rupees ($798 million).

The airline's total liabilities stand at 114.63 billion Indian rupees, including dues to banks, financial institutions, vendors and aircraft lessors.

It's also not clear when the dispute with Pratt & Whitney will be resolved. Go First won an arbitration case in Singapore that ordered the U.S. firm to dispatch spare engines to the airline, and has since approached a Delaware Court to request that it be enforced.

Pratt & Whitney plans to oppose the move, a Delaware court filing showed on Wednesday.

The Indian tribunal said the new resolution professional will take ""all necessary steps including the execution of the arbitral award"".

In its statement, Pratt & Whitney said it will vigorously defend itself against Go's claims, and was pursuing its own legal recourse.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/india-to-decide-on-go-first-bankruptcy-lessors-seeking-planes-fear-impact-3077997,0.065,0.883,0.052,-0.9483

(Bloomberg) -- Beneath the relative calm in American equity markets amid the standoff over the US debt limit, signs are emerging that investors are moving away from companies with outsize reliance on federal government contracts.

A basket of mainly defense contractors compiled by researchers at Citigroup Inc (NYSE: ). has fallen 3.7% in the past four weeks, over 3 percentage points worse than the . The firm screened for companies that derive at least $250 million and 5% of their total annual revenues from federal contracts. It includes Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE: ). — which are both down at least 4% since Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned on May 1 that the government could run out of money to pay bills as early as June 1.

The basket also holds health care and information technology stocks, including Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: ) and Accenture (NYSE: ) Plc, which have slipped as well.

Although there are plenty of other factors weighing on investor sentiment — including recession risk, uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s next moves and sticky inflation — fears of a potential US default are cropping up in parts of the market. Within options, hedges against a volatility breakout are seeing the most demand in five years. And the cost of credit-default swaps on one-year Treasuries has soared to a record.

To the team of Citi strategists including Scott Chronert, US equities are not pricing in enough event risk around a debt-ceiling standoff. While prices have fallen, the 30-day implied volatility for the basket of stocks has dropped all year.

“Investors looking to mitigate event risk could consider some traditional hedges as we expect S&P 500 downside into mid-year,” the strategists wrote.

(Reuters) - Kidde-Fenwal Inc, a subsidiary of Carrier Global (NYSE: ) Corp that specializes in fire control systems, filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, as it buckles under the weight of lawsuits alleging that ""forever chemicals"" in its firefighting foam products have contaminated water sources around U.S. airports and military bases.

Kidde-Fenwal filed for Chapter 11 protection in Delaware bankruptcy court. The company is seeking a buyer for its business, saying its likely liability in the litigation ""substantially exceeds"" its capacity to pay.

Since 2016, Kidde-Fenwal has been named as a defendant in more than 4,400 lawsuits filed by local governments, companies and individuals, claiming that aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) products contaminated drinking water and soil with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS or ""forever chemicals."" Kidde-Fenwal sold AFFF foam products from 2007 to 2013, according to court documents.

Kidde-Fenwal is one of several defendants, along with 3M Co and DuPont de Nemours (NYSE: ) Inc, to face a bellwether trial in June in South Carolina federal court, where AFFF litigation has been consolidated.

The litigation has cost Kidde-Fenwal $6 million in 2023 alone. Kidde-Fenwal has $318 million in assets, and had $200 million in sale revenue for 2022, according to its court filings.

AFFF was jointly developed by 3M and the U.S. military in the 1970s, and has primarily been used to quickly extinguish burning fuel fires at military bases and airports, according to court documents.

Kidde-Fenwal does not make AFFF products, but it previously sold AFFF products through a subsidiary called National Foam. Kidde-Fenwal sold National Foam in 2013 for $77 million to a company that became known as New National Foam, according to court documents.

Carrier Global said Monday that it would support Kidde-Fenwal's efforts to find a buyer in bankruptcy, and that all proceeds from the sale would be available to pay AFFF liabilities and other claims. Carrier said there was ""no assurance"" that it would receive any recovery from a bankruptcy sale.

Carrier took ownership of Kidde-Fenwal when both companies were spun off from United Technologies Corp (NYSE: ) in 2020. Carrier said in a Monday statement that Kidde-Fenwal was an independently managed company and was not a ""strategic fit"" for Carrier going forward.

PFAS are found in thousands of products, from cell phones to food packaging. They have been the subject of an increasing number of lawsuits linking them to cancer, other health risks and environmental damage. 3M, a central defendant in the AFFF lawsuits, has said it would stop producing PFAS by 2025.

The case is In re Kidde-Fenwal Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, No. 23-10638.

For Kidde-Fenwal: Derek Abbott of Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell; and Justin DeCamp of Sullivan & Cromwell

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - None of the Airbus A320neo planes in the Singapore Airlines (OTC: ) group with Pratt & Whitney engines are currently grounded over a lack of spares, Leslie Thng, CEO of Scoot, the airline's low-cost subsidiary, said on Wednesday.

The engines have been under scrutiny since Go Airlines (India) Ltd filed for bankruptcy protection this month, blaming ""faulty"" Pratt engines for the grounding of about half its 54 Airbus A320neos.

Pratt, part of Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) says the claims are without evidence and divert attention from the airline's financial woes.

Scoot has 15 A320neo family planes in its fleet, while premium brand Singapore Airlines instead operates the rival Boeing (NYSE: ) Co 737 family.

""We are expecting to take more deliveries in coming years,"" Thng said of the Airbus narrowbody planes.

His comments were in response to questions at a post-results briefing with analysts and media after Singapore Airlines reported on Tuesday its first annual profit in four years and said the current year was off to a strong start.

India's IndiGo, Germany's Lufthansa and Air New Zealand have said some of their aircraft have been grounded over issues with Pratt GTF engines at a time when spares are in short supply.

Prior to the Go Airlines bankruptcy, about 12% of the A320neo family planes globally with Pratt GTF engines were inactive, compared to just 4% for those with rival engines made by CFM International, aviation consultancy IBA said this month.

Raytheon (NYSE: ) CEO Greg Hayes said in February that the GTF engines' reliability has not been up to expectations and that the company was working to fix problems.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/no-singapore-airlines-group-a320neos-with-pratt-engines-grounded--exec-3084247,0.034,0.946,0.019,-0.5994

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government wants Go Airlines (India) Ltd flights to resume as soon as possible, the civil aviation minister said on Thursday, a week after the troubled low-cost carrier was granted bankruptcy protection.

""We would want a resumption of flights as soon as possible. They have to submit their plan to (the aviation regulator) which will cover the number of planes and routes,"" he added.

LISBON (Reuters) - Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer voiced ""full support"" for Pratt & Whitney as it battles durability problems on recent jet engines, but blamed a separate tussle with engine makers for the suspension of a new turboprop plane project.

Chief Executive Francisco Gomes Neto told reporters that Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) unit Pratt & Whitney was working hard to overcome premature wear problems grounding some jets.

""I am personally involved in this; we recently visited them... We believe they have the competence to resolve the problems,"" Gomes Neto told a media briefing in Portugal, adding that Embraer jets had been less affected than other models.

The world's third-largest planemaker uses Pratt Whitney's Geared Turbofan engines on its latest E2 series of jets.

Similar engines are available on the larger Airbus A320neo family and are at the centre of a dispute between Pratt and India's GoFirst over the cause of the airline's bankruptcy.

Gomes Neto said Embraer was involved in ongoing campaigns for potential commercial jet sales covering a total of more than 200 airplanes, which he said would support a goal of restoring annual jet deliveries to 100 a year within 3-4 years.

Speaking at a media event, he reaffirmed that the company's plans for a new turboprop aircraft were ""on hold"" and blamed a lack of attractive business offers from engine makers.

""We have not yet found the right engine solution,"" he said.

The market for roughly 50-70-seat turboprops is dominated by Franco-Italian firm ATR, owned by Airbus and Leonardo. China is meanwhile developing the Xian MA700.

SPILLOVER

Industry sources say faltering efforts to develop a further competitor reflect the narrow window for a business case in a potentially lucrative but niche market for the sturdy workhorse planes, and spillover from turmoil in the jet engine industry.

Pratt & Whitney Canada is the sole provider of engines for current turboprops, which are used for short regional routes.

General Electric (NYSE: ) has declined to participate in the project, leaving Pratt & Whitney Canada or Rolls-Royce (OTC: ) as potential suppliers, both of which are tackling wider problems.

Recently appointed CEO Tufan Erginbilgic has said Rolls is a ""burning platform"" which needs to improve cash and cut debt. Pratt has said it is actively engaged in its jet engine problems. Rolls declined comment on commercial discussions. Pratt did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Embraer initially planned to spend $1.4 billion to develop a turboprop by re-using an existing fuselage design, but the low-cost approach failed to guarantee the efficiency gains needed to capture enough sales to justify the investment, executives said.

Chief Financial Officer Antonio Carlos Garcia said Embraer would need a partner for a more ambitious but costlier design.

The company has repeatedly said it is looking for an industrial or financial partner for a potential turboprop after a broader tie-up with Boeing (NYSE: ) collapsed in 2020.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/embraer-backs-jet-engine-maker-pratt--whitney-3090612,0.082,0.848,0.069,-0.7827

Raytheon Technologies (RTX) Delivers Fourth Combat-ready Laser Weapon to U.S. Air Force

RTX +1.03% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Last fall, the U.S. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) successfully tested the Air Force's first palletized high-energy laser weapon during four days of continuous live-fire exercises at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico .

The new palletized laser weapon was the first 10-kilowatt laser built to U.S. military specifications in a stand-alone configuration that can be moved and mounted anywhere it's needed. Known as ""H4,"" it is the fourth operational laser weapon system that Raytheon Technologies has delivered to the Air Force and is the eighth total system the company has delivered to the US Department of Defense.

The palletized laser weapon, aimed at protecting people and assets against short-range aerial threats, passed the Air Force's Test and Assessment plan. This included multiple days of live-fire exercises to acquire, target, track and destroy drone targets in short-range attack, swarm attack, and long-range threat scenarios.

""Anywhere the Air Force sees a threat from drones, they now have four proven laser weapons that can be deployed to stop asymmetrical threats,"" said Michael Hofle , senior director of High-Energy Lasers at Raytheon Technologies. ""Whether it's on a fixed location, a flatbed or even a pickup, these laser weapons are compact, rugged and ready to go. That's why we're proud to support the Air Force's effort to provide this new tech to the personnel who need it in the field, who can trust and be confident in the system's capabilities.""

Small enough to fit in the bed of a pickup truck, the laser weapon system comprises a high-energy laser weapon module, a long-range EO/IR sensor that also serves as the beam director, thermal control, internal electrical power, and targeting software—all packaged together for use in the toughest combat environments. It is operated with a laptop and a video game-style controller, and it can plug into a long list of existing air defense, and command and control systems to provide a needed layer of defense.

The palletized laser weapon system was built in the world's first laser weapon factory in McKinney, Texas , and delivered to the Life Cycle Management Center nine months after receipt of order.

(Reuters) - French aerospace engine maker Safran (EPA: ) SA is nearing an approximately $1.8 billion deal to acquire a Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) Corp unit that makes flight controls for aircraft, helicopters and missiles, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The deal rids Raytheon (NYSE: ) of a low-margin business it inherited from its $120 billion merger with United Technologies three years ago, while expanding Safran's foothold in flight controls against rivals such as Moog Inc, Eaton (NYSE: ) Corp, Woodward (NASDAQ: ) Inc and Parker-Hannifin Corp (NYSE: ).

Safran may reach a deal to acquire Raytheon's actuation business that makes flight controls as early as this week, the source said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.

Spokespeople for Safran and Raytheon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Safran said on June 5 it was participating in a ""competitive process"" for Raytheon's flight controls business, without commenting on the chances of an agreement or the terms of a deal. It was responding to a Bloomberg News report that revealed Raytheon was in advanced negotiations with Raytheon about the transaction.

The deal with Raytheon represents Safran's largest acquisition since its $7.7 billion purchase of French aircraft seat maker Zodiac Aerospace in 2018 and is the biggest under Safran CEO Olivier Andries, who took over in 2021.

The Raytheon business will strengthen Safran's ties with Airbus SE (OTC: ), since it sells into many of its commercial aircraft and has some operations in France. It will also expand Safran's relationship with the U.S. military, selling into F-35 and V-22 aircraft.

The actuation unit was previously owned by Rockwell Collins (NYSE: ), a company sold to United Technologies in 2018. Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes has been seeking to streamline its Collins Aerospace business, transferring some offerings to and from other divisions, as he positions it to benefit from airlines putting in more aircraft orders in the wake of strong travel demand.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/safran-nears-18-billion-deal-to-acquire-raytheons-flight-controls-unitsource-3105327,0.004,0.928,0.069,0.9682

PARIS (Reuters) - Jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney flagged ""solid progress"" in the aerospace supply chain on Wednesday, addressing a key area of concern for planemakers as they continue to rack up orders at the Paris Airshow.

The first two days of the world's biggest air show saw bumper orders from Indian airlines looking to cash in on a rapid rebound in travel since the pandemic and forecasts for continued strong growth in the world's most populous country.

In a sign of robust demand elsewhere, industry sources told Reuters on Wednesday that European planemaker Airbus was also putting the finishing touches to a deal with Mexican low-cost carrier Viva Aerobus for 90 narrowbody jets, though the deal would fall outside the show.

But recovery from the pandemic has been more problematic for suppliers, which are still grappling with rising costs, parts shortages and a scarcity of skilled labour.

That has raised concerns whether Airbus and arch rival Boeing (NYSE: ) will be able to hit ambitious goals to ramp up output in order to meet delivery targets for customers.

This week's orders from India alone - for 500 Airbus narrowbody jets from budget carrier IndiGo and a 470-plane deal for both Airbus and Boeing jets finalised by Air India - add almost 1,000 planes to the industry backlog.

SHORTAGES

Pratt & Whitney, a unit of RTX - formerly known as Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), has had a particularly tough time due in part to problems with its GTF engine that have led to the grounding of several planes.

The company said on Wednesday the groundings peaked at 10% of the GTF-powered fleet in the first half of this year, and that percentage would trend lower through the rest of the year.

The GTF is one of two engine options to power Airbus's top-selling A320neo narrowbody aircraft.

Pratt & Whitney President Shane Eddy, who has faced a backlash from airlines over durability problems and a shortage of spare engines, told the air show he was seeing ""solid progress"" in the supply chain.

The company has the capacity in place to support maintenance demand but faces shortages of materials, he added.

Planemakers also face tight labour markets as they strive to lift production, but Airbus said on Wednesday it had filled more than 7,000 of the 13,000 positions it aims to add this year.

The European company, and U.S. rival Boeing, continued to sign new deals at the air show, stoking a debate about whether new fuel-efficient planes will help airlines reduce carbon emissions or whether this will be outweighed by more flights.

Aircraft leasing company Avolon signed a memorandum of understanding to order 20 widebody Airbus A330neo aircraft.

Boeing, meanwhile, won an order for four 737 MAX jets from India's Akasa Air, confirming an earlier Reuters story, while Luxembourg’s flag carrier Luxair also ordered four 737 MAXs.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/paris-air-show-progress-in-supply-chain-as-jet-orders-rack-up-3109860,0.057,0.887,0.056,0.146

PARIS/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Standing at a small booth among a row of other Japanese aerospace suppliers at the Paris Airshow, Yoko Konno is excited at the prospect of new orders for her company, but frowns at long delays to get titanium and the rising cost of chemicals.

""It is challenging but it is a chance to get more business,"" said Konno, a section manager at Japan's Asahi Kinzoku Kogyo, Inc, which produces components and does chrome plating.

Far from the fighter-jet displays and blockbuster plane orders that grabbed headlines at the world's largest air show this week, it's the small and medium-sized suppliers dotting the sprawling exhibition halls that are garnering big attention from senior aerospace officials.

While bosses at Airbus and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) see improvements, labor shortages and delays are expected to remain a key concern for planemakers and large suppliers for more than a year.

""There are issues and lack of capacity almost everywhere,"" said Anne Brachet, executive vice president of Air France-KLM's engineering and maintenance division.

The show is a test of the supply chain's resilience, with some small and medium suppliers both hurting from higher costs and seeing opportunities as large players look for more sources to make parts and components to reduce risk.

Others are wary of making investments in new production without assurances that clients will stick around.

""It's chaos, but everyone's in the same boat,"" said Liam Wiezak, business development manager at Britain's Sigma Aero about the supply chain.

It's raising concerns whether jetmakers Airbus and Boeing (NYSE: ) will be able to hit ambitious goals to ramp up output in order to meet delivery targets, particularly after the show saw orders for almost 1,000 jets from just two Indian carriers.

""Headlines may be dominated by news of record new orders but this is all but irrelevant in the short-medium term,"" said Louis Knight, analyst at research firm Third Bridge.

""The bottlenecks, lead times, sourcing challenges and labor shortages continue to plague the industry, so - regardless of order intake - deliveries remain in full focus.""

Sigma Aero is seeing higher demand for the pipes, ducts and machines it produces for engines and airframes, but the time needed to buy certain raw materials has more than tripled, Wiezak said on the sidelines of the show.

MATERIALS, LABOR

Following the war in Ukraine, planemakers are trying to find alternatives to Russia's VSMPO-Avisma, a key titanium producer to the aerospace industry, which is pushing up demand and creating long waits to buy from other providers.

""Now all the people who used to buy from Russia are shopping in our store,"" said Nik Delic, president of New England Airfoil Products (NEAP) in Connecticut, which purchases U.S.-made titanium.

VSMPO, for example, is the sole source of particular high-strength titanium landing gear, despite increasing production from American, Chinese and Japanese mills, Knight said.

""While its market share may be reduced, it is very hard for the likes of Airbus, Boeing, and (engine maker) Safran (EPA: ) to remove the dependency.""

Purchasing new machines would increase capacity to meet higher demand for the company's airfoils used in engine compressors, but Delic wants a long-term commitment from buyers.

""I have 100 people whose livelihood depends on the success of the company.""

In certain cases, it takes longer to get parts or materials due to some suppliers exiting aerospace during the pandemic.

DCM Group in Canada's Quebec produces parts welded from sheet metal which mostly need protective coatings.

But that segment of the industry is under stress because some companies have closed their doors since COVID-19, said Guillaume Gasparri, executive vice president, business development, for DCM.

Like parts and materials, a shortfall of labor is a key problem for suppliers who can't offer comparable salaries to the large planemakers.

Patrice Arnoux, director of RecAero, said the manufacturer of parts and components had its own training program that takes just over a year to produce workers for the company and others in France's aerospace hub around Toulouse.

Most of the 30 participants this year are unemployed.

""The needs are enormous,"" he said, adding RecAero was looking for 30 workers. ""If we are looking for 30 people, imagine Airbus and Safran.""

Some small and medium-sized suppliers in India see opportunities from the jet buying spree of their local airlines.

Ankit Patel, founder and director of Ankit Fasteners with about 450 employees, was already looking to double capacity in the next three or four years.

""There is a euphoria around India,"" said Patel, whose company supplies fasteners like screws and bolts to Airbus and Boeing. ""Now's the time to capitalise, to say yes, we have capacity on the ground, Airbus and Boeing, look at us we can deliver.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysissmaller-aerospace-suppliers-scramble-for-titanium-workers-in-shadow-of-travel-boom-3110974,0.047,0.872,0.08,0.9844

RTX +1.03% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Pratt & Whitney, an RTX (RTX) business, announced today that it has signed a $5.5 billion modification to the previously awarded F117 Engine Sustainment Support contract with the United States Air Force. The contract provides engine services for C-17s operated by the USAF and eight international partners. The sustainment work will be provided between now and the second half of 2027 and will be conducted at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma as well as facilities in San Francisco and Columbus, Georgia.

The modification further supports U.S. Air Force readiness, affordability and sustainability objectives and includes an engine performance improvement package that will eliminate more than 20 shop visits per year thanks to extended time on wing and save the customer approximately $29 million per year in fuel costs. The package will improve the F117 engine's fuel efficiency, saving up to 6.5 million gallons of fuel annually and reducing CO 2 emissions by up to 140 million pounds per year.

""The global fleet of F117 engines is a benchmark for dependable, safe and reliable propulsion,"" said Jill Albertelli , president of Military Engines at Pratt & Whitney. ""As a trusted Air Force partner, we intend to maintain the strength of this relationship and bring new benefits to the Air Force and the eight F117 international operators.""

This latest upgrade, which is part of the sustainment support contract modification, involves technologies that have been demonstrated, incorporated and are operational in other engine models. The upgraded hardware will be incorporated during routine planned engine maintenance upon the completion of all engineering changes, Service Bulletin publication and all parts being industrialized.

Pratt & Whitney has partnered with the Air Force for over 30 years in the development, production and sustainment of the F117 engine, the exclusive powerplant for the Globemaster III transport aircraft. Pratt & Whitney's F117 engines have accumulated more than 17 million flight hours in support of military and humanitarian missions around the globe, be it airlift missions or overnight combat airdrops in unsecured locations. Certified at 40,440 pounds of thrust, the F117 engine has undergone continuous product improvements enabling it to surpass established goals for time on-wing, in-flight shutdowns and reduced turnaround time.

""One specific product improvement we are looking to incorporate under this contract is a compressor blade coating technology, which according to the Air Force Research Laboratory's estimates, can extend time on wing by up to 16% and reduce fuel burn by over 1%,"" explained Chris Johnson , vice president of Fighter and Mobility Programs at Pratt & Whitney. ""If we can improve durability for the Air Force while lessening impact on the environment, then that is a win-win.""

RTX +1.03% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

RTX business (RTX) Collins Aerospace has announced the completion of flight testing for the MS-110 Multispectral Airborne Reconnaissance System to enter operational service. Following the first flight in July 2022 on an F-16 for an undisclosed international customer, Collins executed a number of extensive flight tests and related ground activities to confirm that the system's wide area, long range sensor suite is now ready for deployment. The company is in the process of delivering a total of 16 sensors to international Fast-Jet operators and is in various stages of contractual activities for another 13 pods for three additional customers.

The advanced MS-110 builds on the success of the widely deployed DB-110 with which it shares a common support and imagery exploitation infrastructure. Existing DB-110 operators have the option of upgrading their pods to the MS-110 configuration at their own maintenance facilities, limiting cost and operational downtime for this critical reconnaissance resource. The multispectral features of the MS-110 improves intelligence analysts' ability to extract vital information from a wide variety of target sets.

""With MS-110 development and integration completed, the critical intelligence made available by the system can be rapidly rolled out to support multi-domain efforts,"" said Andy Hunter , director and general manager, Intelligent Sensing for Collins Aerospace. ""The extension and expansion of an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract with the U.S. Air Force Foreign Military Sales organization will be a major factor in accelerating production and improving system affordability.""

Collins Aerospace airborne reconnaissance systems have been fielded and operational on tactical fast jet platforms such as the F-15 and F-16 as well as special mission ISR business jets. The system is also compatible with MALE UAVs such as the MQ-9. The MS-110 sensor leverages Collins Aerospace's proven multi-spectral imaging (MSI) expertise from SYERS-2C flown on the U-2.",https://www.investing.com/news/assorted/raytheons-collins-aerospace-completes-ms110-flight-integration-on-f16-aircraft-432SI-3126221,0.015,0.865,0.12,0.9848

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan is looking to buy National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS, from the United States to upgrade its air defence capabilities having seen how well they work in Ukraine, the island's defence minister said on Tuesday.

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has stepped up military and political pressure over the past three years to try to force the democratically governed island to accept Beijing's rule.

NASAMS have been provided by the United States for use in Ukraine, with U.S. officials saying they have had a 100% success rate in intercepting Russian missiles.

The system, developed and built by Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) and Norway's Kongsberg Gruppen is a short- to medium-range ground-based air defence system that protects against drone, missile, and aircraft attack, which both Canada and Lithuania have also bought, or are buying for Ukraine.

Asked on the sidelines of parliament about Taiwan buying NASAMS, Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said ""certainly"" there was a proposal to get them.

""This work must be done in accordance with the enemy situation,"" he said. ""We have seen from the Russia-Ukraine war that these weapons definitely have good performance.""

However, Taiwan has not received any official notification from the U.S. that they will sell NASAMS to Taipei, Chiu said.

""But we need this work to be done as soon as possible.""

The U.S., Taiwan's main foreign source of weapons, formally makes notifications to the island about the arms Washington is willing to sell.

The U.S. is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, despite a lack of formal diplomatic relations. China routinely denounces such arms sales.

Taiwan's military has been paying close attention to the war in Ukraine for lessons on defending against a much larger opponent, for example by the use of drones.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/taiwan-says-looking-to-buy-nasams-air-defence-system-from-us-3127417,0.066,0.864,0.07,-0.8155

RTX +1.03% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Morgan Stanley downgraded Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ) to an equal-weight rating (From Overweight) and cut their 12-month price target on the stock to $95.00 (from $110.00) after the aerospace and defense company reported an unexpected manufacturing defect during their 2Q earnings report.

RTX saw a drop of 10.2% in their share price on Tuesday, following the disclosure of a manufacturing flaw associated with the Pratt & Whitney high pressure turbine (HPT) discs used in the Airbus A320neo Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine. The defect traces back to contaminated powdered metals produced from 2015 to 2021, impacting the functioning of the HPT discs in some engines shipped from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the third quarter of 2021. However, RTX assured that they have enhanced the manufacturing process since 2021 and that the HPT discs being manufactured presently are defect-free.

“The underperformance of the stock reflected the unexpected negative surprise regarding the manufacturing defect of the Pratt & Whitney high pressure turbine (HPT) discs,” wrote analysts.

“In our view, the risk of unknown unknowns of the GTF could weigh on sentiment in the near- and medium-term especially considering the teething issues of the engine in its early years, the durability issues highlighted at the Paris Air Show (link), and this new HPT disc issue,” they added.

RTX anticipates that around 1,200 PW1100G-JM engines will be impacted by this defect. Corrective measures would involve detaching the engine from the wing of the affected models, disassembling the engine, extracting the HPT disc, carrying out a comprehensive inspection of the component, replacing the defective part, reassembling the engine, and finally reattaching it.

RTX has not released any information on the cost impact of the 1,000 engines that need to be inspected. If the costs are lower than updated estimates post 2Q23, upward revisions in earnings could create a positive catalyst. However, costs depend on how many engines are already scheduled for a check-up in 2024 and how many will need a quick engine visit. Also, costs depend on the duration of the engine visit as Pratt may be required to make airline customers “whole” depending on specific contract terms.

Morgan Stanley cut their 2023 adjusted EPS estimate to $4.95 from $5.00 and lowered FCF estimates to $4.1 billion from $4.9 billion. Revenue estimates were relatively unchanged as Morgan Stanley factors in a potential headwind to revenue of ~$750M as a result of the agreement reached to divest Collins' actuation and flight control business offset by better core growth. 2024 EPS estimates were cut to $5.85 from $6.05.

The worst is behind Boeing (NYSE: ) says Bank of America analysts after upgrading the stock’s rating to Buy from Neutral.

Shares in the aero and defense giant surged as much as 8.7% on Wednesday following the company’s second-quarter . Boeing reported revenue of $19.75 billion, easily ahead of the Street at $18.49B.

Even more positively, the company said it generated $2.58B in adjusted free cash flow while analysts were expecting outflows of $73.6 million.

BofA especially highlighted robust demand for Boeing’s planes.

“We believe that demand is strong enough for Boeing to grow further, even if it were to only maintain its ~40% share of the narrowbody market. Additionally, we believe the 787 will remain the widebody of choice, holding onto the lion’s share of the widebody market vs. its competitors. We also expect there to be ample demand for 10 787s/month through the outyears,” the analysts said in a note.

Their new rating is accompanied by a $300 per share price target. Boeing shares are up a further 1% in pre-open Thursday.

“We are currently in the midst of the post-COVID commercial recovery with passenger demand emerging back to pre-pandemic levels. On the defense side, both domestic and international demand continues to accelerate, with investment outlays at new peak levels,” they added.

On the other hand, the analysts downgraded Raytheon (NYSE: ) to Neutral from Buy with a $95 per share price target.

The downgrade call comes “on account of amplified headwinds on the GTF program and a slower margin ramp at Raytheon. The most recent powder metal issue suggests that smoother waters at P&W likely remain further out on the horizon than previously expected.

(Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday it will require some users of Pratt & Whitney's geared turbofan engine to conduct inspections within 30 days to prevent a part failure that could damage the airplane.

Pratt & Whitney parent RTX Corp announced in July that a ""rare condition"" in powdered metal meant 1,200 of more than 3,000 engines, built for the twin-engined Airbus A320neo between 2015 and 2021, have to be taken off and inspected for micro cracks.

In an airworthiness directive published on Friday, the FAA requires an ultrasonic inspection of the first- and second-stage high-pressure turbine disks within 30 days. If the disks show signs of fatigue, they must be replaced before further flight, the agency said.

The FAA said the directive, which is effective immediately, affects 20 engines on U.S.-registered aircraft and 202 engines worldwide.

After a December 2022 incident where a failure of the GTF's high-pressure compressor resulted in an aborted takeoff, RTX conducted analysis that found the disks were more susceptible to failure ""much earlier"" than previously believed, the airworthiness directive said.

Pratt & Whitney issued an instruction to operators on Aug. 4 to expedite inspections of the disks.

""Material anomalies"" such as microcracking in the disks ""could lead to premature fracture and uncontained failure, which indicates an immediate safety of flight problem,"" the directive states.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will spend A$1.3 billion ($833 million) to boost its long-range strike capabilities as it finalised on Monday a deal to buy more than 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles from the United States, part of a wide-ranging defence shake-up.

Australia will be only one of three nations to have Tomahawks along with the U.S. and Britain, Defence Minister Richard Marles said.

""We are investing in the capabilities our Defence Force needs to hold our adversaries at risk further from our shores and keep Australians safe in the complex and uncertain world in which we live today,"" Marles said in a statement.

The U.S. State Department in March approved the sale of the Tomahawks, which have a range of 1,500 kms (932 miles), but did not indicate at the time that a contract had been signed or talks had concluded.

The ship-launched version of the missiles, manufactured by RTX Corp, will be deployed on the Royal Australian Navy's Hobart-class destroyers, he said.

Australia says it needs to upgrade its defence forces as China is undertaking the biggest military build-up since the end of World War Two.

Earlier this year it agreed to work with the United States and Britain to develop a nuclear-powered submarine fleet.

In addition to the Tomahawks, Australia would spend about A$431 million to purchase more than 60 advanced anti-radiation guided missiles from the United States, the defence minister said.

Long-range anti-tank guided missiles would also be bought for Australian Army's Boxer combat reconnaissance vehicles in a contract worth more than A$50 million.

The Tomahawk announcement came days after the U.S. approved a possible sale to Australia of M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) for $975 million.

(Reuters) -Wizz Air said on Monday it estimates a potential 10% capacity reduction in the second half of fiscal 2024, due to an inspection of Pratt & Whitney's turbofans.

Aerospace supplier RTX had earlier in the day said 600 to 700 geared turbofan engines (GTF) will have to be removed for quality checks that will likely cause some of its aircraft to be grounded.

While airline operators around the world have struggled to increase capacity to meet the boom in demand for travel after pandemic restrictions eased, Wizz, which flies Airbus planes, has had to navigate additional challenges after Pratt & Whitney earlier in the year said more than 1,000 engines needed to be removed from Airbus planes and checked for microscopic cracks.

Wizz said it will continue to work with RTX unit Pratt & Whitney to minimize the impact to its fleet plan and costs to the business, adding it will be seeking financial compensation.

Separately, German partner MTU Aero Engines (OTC: ), which controls 18% of the GTF program, warned its own revenue and profit could be impacted this year.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/wizz-air-sees-10-capacity-reduction-in-h2-2024-amid-pratt--whitney-inspection-3171794,0.025,0.938,0.037,0.4019

RTX +1.03% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

By Valerie Insinna and Abhijith Ganapavaram

(Reuters) -Shares in Pratt & Whitney parent RTX Corp hit a two-year low on Monday as it took a $3 billion charge and told airlines hundreds of their Airbus jets would be grounded at any one time in coming years to check for a rare manufacturing flaw.

The warning comes on top of a spate of durability problems for Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbofan series, which RTX -- then named Raytheon (NYSE: ) -- acquired through an industry merger in 2020.

In July, RTX said a rare powder metal defect could lead to the cracking of some engine components and called for accelerated inspections affecting 200 engines by mid-September.

On Monday, it said it now estimates it will have to pull a total of 600 to 700 engines off their Airbus A320neo jets for lengthy quality inspections between 2023 and 2026.

Repair work that CEO Greg Hayes had initially expected would take 60 days is now projected to last up to 300 days per engine. An average of 350 jets could be grounded per year through 2026, with as many as 650 jets sitting idle in the first half of 2024.

RTX shares fell 7.9% in late trading to $76.89 after hitting a low of $76.71. In Paris, Airbus shares fell 1.3%.

Pratt & Whitney competes with GE-Safran joint-venture CFM to power the A320neo series, which competes with the exclusively CFM-powered Boeing (NYSE: ) 737 MAX.

Disclosing higher-than-expected gross costs of $6-7 billion for dealing with the problem, RTX said it expected an up to $3.5 billion pre-tax hit to profits over the next several years.

It lowered its $9 billion free cash flow goal for 2025 to approximately $7.5 billion, and decreased its projected reported sales figure for 2023 by $5.5 billion.

German partner MTU Aero Engines (OTC: ), which controls 18% of the GTF program, said it might have to bear 1 billion euros in extra costs but that it was too early to say how this year's financial goals would be affected.

Speaking to analysts, Hayes acknowledged the problem ""will have a significant impact on our customers.""

Some have already been forced to park their A320neo-family jets to wait for spare engines following durability problems.

Hungary's Wizz Air, one of Europe's largest lost-cost airlines, estimated that its capacity could be reduced by 10% in the second half of 2024 by the powder issue.

Germany's Lufthansa, which was first to introduce the GTF engine series, said it was evaluating the situation.

AIRBUS KEEPS DELIVERY GOAL

Of U.S. carriers, Spirit Airlines (NYSE: ), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: ) and Hawaiian Airlines have the largest exposure to the GTF problem, according to Jefferies. None of the airlines responded immediately to a request for comment.

Robert Stallard, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said the RTX charges were larger than expected.

Airbus said the problem is not expected to impact 2023 deliveries or the planned production ramp-up in 2024.

Industry sources said the new checks could exacerbate a tug of war for engines between airplane factories and repair shops, as airlines clamor for engines to be diverted from assembly lines and made available as spares to keep existing jets flying.

Already grappling with fractured supply chains, Airbus has so far been reluctant to soften delivery targets in order to release engines to the spares pool.

The quality issue relates to a ""rare condition"" in powder metal used to manufacture engine parts, such as high pressure turbine disks and high-pressure compressor disks, that could result in micro-cracks and fatigue.

During a production ramp up in 2015, a microscopic contaminant was introduced into the powdered metal made by RTX subsidiary HMI in Clayville, New York, which could not be detected by previous inspection methods, Hayes said.

""At last count there have been nine changes to the process to ensure the purity of the powder,"" said Hayes who added he is ""confident"" the problem is resolved.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/rtx-expects-3-billion-hit-in-q3-from-pratt--whitney-gtf-engine-issues-3171584,0.073,0.899,0.027,-0.9865

Rtx Corp (NYSE: ) was cut to Underperform from Neutral with a new price target of $75, down from $95 per share at BofA on Thursday.

In a note to clients, analysts revealed they are cutting the stock due to increased geared turbofan (GTF) related risks in the near term.

""Following recent geared turbofan (GTF) developments, Raytheon's stock slid significantly, closing down 9.48% after three days of trading (vs. the flat). While some may think RTX is now a 'value' investment, we advise caution as we see significant near-term risks,"" they warned.

""We think RTX will underperform our coverage universe until there is a clearer understanding of the necessary fixes, customer concessions and even organizational changes in the wake of this egregious manufacturing oversight,"" they added.

The analysts also noted several other near-term risks, including higher-than-expected customer concessions, the increased scope of engine types impacted, the increased scope of subcomponents impacted, incremental reputational damage to RTX's management team and brand, and the restructuring risk at RTX's legacy defense business.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bofa-sees-several-nearterm-risks-for-rtx-432SI-3174625,0.086,0.855,0.059,-0.6705

(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (NYSE: ) said on Thursday in the near term it is expecting a minimal hit from recently disclosed quality issues with RTX's Pratt & Whitney engines but added it was yet to fully assess the impact.

The airline expects a more detailed assessment from Pratt & Whitney at the end of this month, Delta's finance chief Dan Janki said during a conference organized by Morgan Stanley.

Earlier this week, RTX said it would have to pull 600 to 700 of its Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines from Airbus A320neo jets for quality inspections over the next three years.

The problem arose due to a powder metal defect that can lead to cracks in some Pratt & Whitney engine components. RTX initially estimated repair work per engine to last 60 days, but it is now expected to take up to 300 days.

Speaking about the impact, Janki said ""I think (it) will be minimal at this point, but we got to assess it.""

""You got to look at the secondary impacts as it relates to new deliveries, other knock-on effects in a supply chain that continues to be fragile in nature.""

Delta had taken delivery of Airbus A321neos ""later in the cycle"" and will end 2023 with just under 50 neos, Janki added.

Shares of the carrier fell nearly 1% during market hours after rising over 2% before the bell.

The airline raised its current-quarter revenue forecast earlier in the day as Americans' thirst for travel to Europe lifted demand for lucrative transatlantic flights.

The carrier said it expects third-quarter revenue to rise within the upper half of its forecast range of 11% to 14% growth.

However, it slashed its quarterly forecasts for operating margin and profit as extended oil production cuts by Russia and Saudi Arabia drove the airline's fuel expenses higher.

The carrier now expects a profit of $1.85 to $2.05 per share in the third quarter, down from its prior forecast of $2.20 to $2.50 per share.

(Reuters) -U.S. government services would be disrupted and hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be told not to work if Congress fails to provide funding for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Workers deemed essential would remain on the job. Almost all workers would not be paid.

Here is a guide to what would stay open and what would shut down, according to agency shutdown plans:

MILITARY

The 2 million U.S. military personnel would remain at their posts, but roughly half of the Pentagon's 800,000 civilian employees would be furloughed -- ordered not to work.

Contracts awarded before the shutdown would continue, and the Pentagon could place new orders for supplies or services needed to protect national security. Other new contracts, including renewals or extensions, would not be awarded. Payments to defense contractors such as Boeing (NYSE: ), Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) and RTX, formerly known as Raytheon (NYSE: ), could be delayed.

The Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration would continue maintaining nuclear weapons.

LAW ENFORCEMENT

Agents at the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and other federal law enforcement agencies would remain on the job, and prison staffers would continue to work.

The Secret Service and the Coast Guard would also continue operations, and most employees would continue to work.

Most of the Federal Trade Commission's consumer-protection workers would be furloughed, as would half of its antitrust employees.

SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND OTHER BENEFITS

The Social Security Administration would continue to issue retirement and disability benefits, though the agency might have to delay its announcement of its annual increase in payments.

Payments would likewise continue under the Medicare and Medicaid healthcare programs.

Military veterans' benefits would also continue, according to a 2021 contingency plan.

Nutrition benefits provided to 7 million mothers through the Women, Infants and Children program would be cut within days, according to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.

Food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would go out as normal for October, but could be affected after that.

NATIONAL PARKS AND NATURAL RESOURCES

National parks, monuments and other sites would be closed to the public, though it will be impossible to keep visitors out of many of them. Rangers would be furloughed and restrooms, help desks and other facilities would be shuttered.

Some states may use their own money to keep parks and other sites open, as happened in the 2018-2019 shutdown.

Wildfire fighting efforts would continue, according to the Agriculture Department's 2020 contingency plan, though timber sales on national forest lands would be curtailed and fewer recreation permits would be issued.

MUSEUMS

The Smithsonian museums that line the National Mall have enough money on hand to stay open for about a week after a shutdown, as would the National Zoo. After that, they would close to the public, though zoo staffers would continue to care for animals.

BORDERS AND HOMELAND SECURITY

Most Border Patrol and immigration enforcement agents would continue to work, as would most customs officers.

Local governments would not get new aid to shelter migrants.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency would suspend security reviews that help schools, local governments and other institutions defend against ransomware.

FEDERAL COURTS

Federal courts have enough money to stay open until at least Oct. 13. Activities might be scaled back after that point. The Supreme Court would stay open as well.

Criminal prosecutions, including the two federal cases against former President Donald Trump, would continue. Most civil litigation would be postponed. The government's landmark Google (NASDAQ: ) antitrust lawsuit would continue.

CONGRESS

Lawmakers would continue to collect paychecks, even as other federal workers do not. Staffers would not get paid, though those deemed essential would be required to work.

TRANSPORTATION

Airport security screeners and air-traffic control workers would be required to work, according to recent contingency plans, though absenteeism could be a problem. Some airports had to suspend operations during a shutdown in 2019 when traffic controllers called in sick.

Training for 1,000 new air-traffic controllers would stop, leaving the system understaffed. The Transportation Security Administration would not be able to hire new airport security screeners ahead of the busy holiday travel season.

Some major infrastructure projects could face delays because environmental reviews and permitting would be disrupted, according to the White House.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS

U.S. embassies and consulates would remain open. Passport and visa processing would continue as long as there were sufficient fees to cover operations. Nonessential official travel, speeches and other events would be curtailed.

Some foreign aid programs could run out of money as well.

SCIENCE

Scientific research would be disrupted as agencies like the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) would furlough most of their workers once they run out of funding.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) would continue to support the International Space Station and track satellites, but 17,000 of its 18,300 employees would be furloughed.

Weather forecasts and fisheries regulation would continue, as would patent and trademark reviews. Tests of new drugs and medical devices would continue.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would suspend consumer-protection activities, equipment reviews, and licensing of TV and radio stations. It would continue to distribute telecommunications subsidies and its broadband mapping effort.

HEALTH

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would continue to monitor disease outbreaks, though other public health activities could suffer as more than half of the agency's workers would be furloughed.

The National Institutes of Health would furlough most of its staff and delay new clinical trials for medical treatments.

Healthcare services for military veterans and Native Americans would continue.

Most inspections of hazardous waste sites and drinking water and chemical facilities would stop.

Food-safety inspections by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could be delayed.

FINANCIAL REGULATION

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would furlough roughly 90% of its 4,600 employees and suspend most activities, leaving only a skeleton staff to respond to emergencies.

Likewise, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) would furlough almost all of its employees and cease most oversight activity.

The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would continue as normal because they are funded by industry fees rather than congressional appropriations.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), an industry-financed brokerage oversight body, would continue to operate.

The Treasury Department would continue to issue debt and manage the government's cash position.

ECONOMIC DATA

The publication of major U.S. economic data, including employment and inflation reports of critical importance to policymakers and investors, would be suspended.

TAX COLLECTION

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would stop examining and auditing tax returns and responding to taxpayer queries. Automated tax collection would continue, as would processing of green-energy tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. Roughly two-thirds of the agency's 90,000 employees would be furloughed.

DISASTER RESPONSE

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would be at risk of running out of disaster-relief funds. The agency is already delaying payments to some long-term recovery projects in order to keep money on hand for more immediate relief during the hurricane and wildfire seasons.

EDUCATION

Pell Grants and student loans would continue to be paid, but could be disrupted as most Education Department employees would be furloughed, according to the agency's 2021 plan.

A protracted shutdown could ""severely curtail"" aid to schools, universities and other educational institutions, the department says. It also could delay funds that are due to be awarded later in the year.

WATERWAYS

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would continue to operate locks, dams and flood control facilities. Most employees would not be furloughed.

CHILD CARE

According to the White House, 10,000 children from low-income families would lose access to the Head Start preschool program.

SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT

The Small Business Administration would not be able to issue any new loans, though loans for businesses hurt by natural disasters would continue.

AGRICULTURE

Meat and egg inspections would continue, but some lab services would be disrupted, making it harder to fight animal diseases. Crop insurance would not be affected, but some loan programs would be. Research, conservation and rural development programs would be shut down.

LABOR

Workplace safety inspections would be limited, and investigations into unfair pay practices would be suspended, according to the White House.

The ability of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to mediate labor disputes would be curtailed because almost all of its 1,200 employees would be furloughed, according to a 2022 plan.

HOUSING

Monthly subsidies for public housing and low-income housing aid would be at risk. The Federal Housing Administration would continue to back insured mortgages, and Ginnie Mae would continue to back the secondary mortgage market. New homebuyers in rural areas would not be able to get loans from the Agriculture Department.

WHITE HOUSE

In the 2018-2019 shutdown, the White House furloughed 1,100 of 1,800 staff in the Executive Office of the President. Some offices, such as the National Security Council, continued at full strength, while others like the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) were scaled back sharply.

White House furloughs could make it harder for Republicans in the House of Representatives to get information for their impeachment investigation of Democratic President Joe Biden.

The U.S. Constitution specifies that the president continues to get paid.

MAIL DELIVERY

The U.S. Postal Service would be unaffected because it does not depend on Congress for funding.",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/factboxus-government-shutdown-what-closes-what-stays-open-3184350,0.077,0.834,0.088,0.9734

RTX (RTX) selected by Boeing for X-66A NASA Sustainable Flight Demonstrator Project

RTX +1.03% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

RTX (RTX) has been selected by Boeing as a collaborator on the X-66A flight demonstrator, part of NASA's Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project. Two RTX business units, Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace, will support Boeing with Pratt & Whitney GTF™ engines, and Collins nacelles and engine accessories. Pratt & Whitney and Collins will also support ground and flight tests, slated to start in 2028.

The Sustainable Flight Demonstrator is part of NASA's broader Sustainable Flight National Partnership, which is dedicated to developing the technologies needed to achieve net-zero CO 2 emissions for commercial aviation. Boeing's X-66A program is focused on developing the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing (TTBW) concept, which could enable significant improvements in fuel efficiency and reduced emissions for next generation single-aisle aircraft.

""NASA's Sustainable Flight Demonstrator is a leading example of how public-private partnerships can help foster the technological breakthroughs needed to deliver on the industry-wide goal of a more sustainable, net-zero emissions future,"" said Geoff Hunt , senior vice president of Engineering & Technology at Pratt & Whitney. ""We'll work with Boeing to apply GTF engines to the X-66A and help demonstrate the potential of its pioneering truss-braced wing design.""

The GTF engine, with its revolutionary geared fan architecture, delivers industry-leading fuel efficiency and sustainability benefits for single-aisle aircraft. With up to 20% better fuel efficiency, GTF engines have helped airlines save more than 1.4 billion gallons of fuel and over 14 million metric tons of CO 2 emissions since entering service in 2016. GTF engines are certified to operate with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and offer up to a 75% reduction in aircraft noise footprint compared to previous generation engines.

""Collins has a long history of successful partnerships with NASA, Boeing, and Pratt & Whitney, with decades of experience pushing the boundaries of innovation in aerospace,"" said Dr. Mauro Atalla , senior vice president, Engineering & Technology for Collins. ""Now, as part of the Sustainable Flight Demonstrator program, we will work together to demonstrate new technologies and systems to support the next generation of low-emission single-aisle aircraft that will play an integral role in reducing the environmental footprint of the aviation industry.""

Collins' nacelles consist of lightweight and durable composite and metallic materials that encase the engine and serve many functions, including safeguarding the engine, controlling airflow, reducing noise and facilitating thrust reversal for deceleration during aircraft landings. In addition, Collins provides the control system components for the GTF engine, including heat exchangers, the integrated fuel pump and control, the air turbine starter and electronic controls.

""The learnings from the Sustainable Flight Demonstrator, X-66, and the partnership with NASA are important elements in the industry's efforts to decarbonize aviation,"" said Dr. Todd Citron , Boeing's Chief Technology Officer. ""We're grateful for the support from RTX on this critical effort.""

RTX is advancing a wide range of technologies to support the future of sustainable aviation, including engine readiness for unblended 100% SAF, hybrid-electric propulsion and hydrogen fuel. Pratt & Whitney and Collins are also collaborating with NASA on other Sustainable Flight National Partnership projects, including Hybrid Thermally Efficient Core (HyTEC) and Hi-Rate Composite Aircraft Manufacturing (HiCAM).",https://www.investing.com/news/assorted/rtx-selected-by-boeing-for-x66a-nasa-sustainable-flight-demonstrator-project-432SI-3189077,0.005,0.876,0.119,0.9953

RTX (RTX) to Develop Rotating Detonation Engine for DARPA

RTX +1.03% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Raytheon, an RTX (RTX) business, has received a contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop Gambit, an air-breathing propulsion demonstration program that uses a novel rotating detonation engine. This type of engine is more compact, provides a higher efficiency propulsion source than conventional missile propulsion and offers the potential for lower costs.

Gambit is a first-of-its-kind engine development program that could support future weapons systems for multiple military services. The compact nature of the engine and its efficient combustion provide a boost in range and speed relative to current long-range weapons, allowing the ability to quickly respond to advanced threats.

""This is a revolutionary propulsion system,"" said Colin Whelan , president of Advanced Technology at Raytheon. ""We're leveraging existing digital design tools and experience from across the entire RTX business to rapidly prototype this next-generation strike weapon and mature the technology.""

Under the contract, RTX will rely heavily on iterative development of performance models which will be anchored by real-world data from incremental system tests. This proven method accelerates learning to provide more certain flight test outcomes, saving both time and cost. Future optional phases of the Gambit program will shift to building hardware to conduct a flight weight free-jet test.

With this contract, RTX becomes the first company to apply rotating detonation engine technology into an actual test system.",https://www.investing.com/news/assorted/rtx-to-develop-rotating-detonation-engine-for-darpa-432SI-3190286,0.055,0.832,0.112,0.8977

By Sinéad Carew and Shashwat Chauhan

(Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes closed higher on Monday while energy stocks rallied as investors digested the latest news about the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.

The Israeli military said it called up reservists and was imposing a total blockade of the Gaza Strip in signs it could be planning a ground assault there to defeat Hamas which launched a deadly attack over the weekend.

But late in the afternoon, a senior Hamas official said the group is open to discussions over a possible truce with Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden said he directed his team to coordinate with regional partners to warn anyone seeking to take advantage of the situation.

News of the conflict sparked an oil rally due to supply concerns. But stock indexes managed to reverse earlier declines with help of more dovish Federal Reserve official comments.

As a result investors appeared to refocus on more U.S. centric matters, John Augustine, said chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio.

""The stock market and investors are focused on two things, the economy and earnings. The U.S. economy is not slowing and earnings are expected to come out of a recession with reports starting this week,"" Augustine said.

""Those fundamentals are more powerful in the market than terrible geopolitical headlines from the weekend just as they were more powerful than a strong jobs report and worries about the Fed on Friday.""

The U.S. bond market was shut on Monday for Columbus Day, also known as Indigenous Peoples' Day.

A recent surge in U.S. Treasury yields had pressured equities. That pressure eased as gains in the iShares Core 10+ years U.S. bond Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) and the iShares 20+ years Treasury bond ETF suggested that yields could fall on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Fed officials indicated that recent gains in yields on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds, which directly influence financing costs for households and businesses, could steer the Fed from further hikes in its short-term policy rate. This eased some concerns among equity investors.

The rose 197.07 points, or 0.59%, to 33,604.65. The gained 27.16 points, or 0.63%, at 4,335.66 and the added 52.90 points, or 0.39%, at 13,484.24.

After rising as high as 19.6 during the session, the CBOE volatility index, often referred to as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" ended at 17.70.

But traditional safe-haven assets remained in demand, with gold climbing 1.6%, although the gave up earlier gains and was down 0.18%.

Rising oil prices boosted the S&P energy sector, which ended up 3.5%, making it the biggest gainer among the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors.

United Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE: ) and American Airlines (NASDAQ: ) suspended direct flights to Tel Aviv. Shares of the airlines, also hurt by rising oil prices, ended down more than 4% each. This put pressure on the S&P 500 Passenger Airlines index, which lost 3.7%.

Defense companies had rallied after the news from Israel, with the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense index ending up 5.6% for its biggest one-day percentage gain since November 2020. Its biggest advancers were Northrop Grumman (NYSE: ), which rose 11.4%, and L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: ), which added 9.96%.

Exchange-traded funds exposed to Israel were selling off, with iShares MSCI Israel ETF falling 7% while the ARK Israel Innovative Technology ETF fell 5%.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.19-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted eight new 52-week highs and 19 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 37 new highs and 326 new lows.

Asian stock futures in Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia reflected Wall Street's rally on Tuesday. The surge came as Federal Reserve officials downplayed the likelihood of a 2023 Fed rate hike, despite the recent surge in Treasury yields. The Israeli-Hamas conflict, which has caused a spike in oil prices due to potential threats to energy supplies, has also resulted in significant gains for gold as investors sought safe havens.

On Monday, the stock market rallied after Fed vice chair Philip Jefferson and Dallas Fed president Lorie Logan highlighted the impact of rising Treasury yields on monetary policy. They emphasized the role of high bond yields in maintaining restrictive financial conditions for price stability. Despite US bond markets being closed for Columbus Day and Indigenous Peoples Day, futures trading signaled a rise in government debt demand.

The Israeli-Hamas conflict has had significant repercussions on global markets. A surprise attack by Hamas on Israel led to a rebound in crude prices with West Texas Intermediate and rising significantly. This sparked a surge in oil and gas stocks like ExxonMobil (NYSE: ) and Chevron (NYSE: ), as well as defense contractors such as RTX Corp, Northrop Grumman (NYSE: ), and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ). However, Israeli companies Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE: ) Ltd. and Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ: ) Ltd. saw a decrease in US trading.

In contrast, airlines incurred losses while Disney stocks rose after activist investor Nelson Peltz increased his stake. IG analyst Chris Beauchamp underscored the absence of potential oil supply increases in the oil rally.

UBS Global Wealth Management favors fixed income over equities amidst ongoing geopolitical issues. Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson warned about fiscal policy constraints posing risks to US stocks at a time when the Fed is fighting high inflation.

Key events this week include the forthcoming Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the release of last meeting's minutes, IMF's latest world economic outlook and quarterly earnings results from Citigroup (NYSE: ), JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock (NYSE: ).

The recent rise in global conflicts, including the Israel-Hamas conflict, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the perceived rise of China has led to a significant increase in international arms sales. This surge has notably benefited American weapons manufacturers such as the Raytheon (NYSE: ) division of RTX Corp.

On Tuesday, it was reported that the U.S. has been supplying Israel with smart bombs, ammunition, and interceptors for the Iron Dome missile-defense system. In addition to this, military aid is being provided to Ukraine and other European allies like Poland.

According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, worldwide military spending reached $2.2 trillion last year. This rising demand has sparked increased arms production from nations including Turkey and South Korea.

Major buyers of these arms include NATO ally Poland, which has been granted the right to purchase Abrams tanks built by General Dynamics (NYSE: ), Lockheed Martin’s HIMARS and Hellfire missile systems, and Boeing (NYSE: ) F-15 fighter jets.

Middle Eastern nations like Israel and Saudi Arabia continue to be significant buyers of American weapons. Meanwhile, Indonesia is shifting its purchases from Russia to Western suppliers, including Blackhawk helicopters from Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ).

The surge in arms purchases has raised concerns about an escalation in global conflicts. Jeff Abramson, an arms control advocate at the Center for International Policy, noted these concerns. Despite these worries, the surge has bolstered the bottom line for big military contractors. Pentagon notifications of proposed foreign military sales surpassed $90.5 billion in the first nine months of this year alone.

The U.S government is leveraging this demand to expand military alliances with new customers like India and Indonesia while selling more to existing allies. Poland recently added Turkey to its list of weapons suppliers by purchasing Baykar's armed drones.

Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jets have secured approval or sales agreements worth as much as $50 billion with several countries. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III has visited Indonesia to encourage the nation to buy Boeing-built F-15 fighter jets.

However, the main bottleneck remains manufacturing capacity, as noted by James Hursch, director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. This surge in demand for arms amidst geopolitical tensions is testing the limits of global arms production capabilities.

Manufacturing defects in key products such as the 737 MAX and GTF engines have led to third-quarter losses for RTX, Boeing (NYSE: ), and Spirit. The RTX subsidiary, Pratt & Whitney, is preparing for a $3 billion charge this quarter due to the replacement of contaminated components in nearly 700 GTF engines. Concurrently, Boeing and Spirit are dealing with issues related to misdrilled holes on the 737 MAX.

Rob Stallard of Vertical Research Partners anticipates losses per share of 24 cents for RTX, $2.23 for Boeing, and $1.03 for Spirit. He referred to these firms as the sector's ""problem children"". Ron Epstein from Bank of America warned about potential repair delays and increased customer compensations.

Investors are closely monitoring Boeing's projected free cash flow of $3-$5 billion by 2023. However, this target may be jeopardized if the company fails to meet its delivery target of 400 737s this year.

Spirit's interim CEO Patrick Shanahan, known for his problem-solving abilities, has been given the responsibility of improving Spirit's financial health and increasing production efficiency. Michel Merluzeau from AIR consultancy group underscored the grave situation at Spirit.

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

Big Tech heavyweights Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are set to switch global investors' focus from Monday's bond market bounce, although the latter has improved the market mood considerably ahead of the week's big earnings reports.

The two tech giants report after the bell on Tuesday, with Meta (NASDAQ: ) following on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday. These four stocks combined account for a whopping 23.4% weighting in the - just shy of their 24% pandemic peak and twice the share they held just six years ago.

Partly lifted by the year's artificial intelligence craze, the tech behemoths have clearly flattered year-to-date gains of 10% in the overall S&P500. And on an equal-weighted basis, the index is actually down 3.6% for 2023 so far.

And yet the seemingly endless squeeze in bond markets since midyear has seen megacap indexes retreat some 12% from their highs for the year.

The sight of 10-year Treasury yields topping 5% for the first time in 16 years early on Monday underscored that angst - but the pressure eased significantly during the session as some bond buyers emerged above to lock in yields above that threshold.

The reason for the rather sudden 10-year recoil on Monday were sketchy beyond the breach of the milestone, though it coincided with some major investors claiming it was time to close short positions on Treasuries.

Billionaire investor Bill Ackman said the covered his previous bets against Treasuries on an expectation U.S. economic numbers would deteriorate from here and the Gaza war would push more investor dollars towards U.S. government bonds.

Perhaps ironically, it was also an ebbing oil price after the weekend - amid hostage releases and aid convoys that stirred some hope for a temporary ceasefire in Israel's military retaliation in Gaza - that helped bonds bounce on the day.

More broadly, sovereign debt prices were also helped on Tuesday by signs of mounting pressure on business activity around the world from spiralling borrowing costs, anxious geopolitics and China's economic problems.

Euro zone business activity took a surprise turn for the worse this month as demand fell in a broad-based downturn across the region, early ""flash"" surveys for October showed. The euro fell back sharply from one-month highs.

Sister surveys for the United States are due out later by contrast.

Britain's labour market also lost more of its inflationary heat in the three months to August, according to new data, potentially helping the Bank of England to keep interest rates on hold next week and dragging down gilt yields.

The upshot of the whole picture is to give U.S. stock futures a lift ahead of the open on Tuesday - with Asia and European bourses in positive territory too as bond markets stabilised. The Vix volatility gauge fell back below 20 from seven-month highs of 23 hit in the previous session.

Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields held about 4.83% - some 19 basis points below Monday's peak at 5.02%. The dollar bounced from one-month lows to trade higher on the day.

Treasury auctions this week will again test demand for U.S. government paper, with $51 billion of 2-year notes up for sale on Tuesday, $52 billion in 5-year notes due on Wednesday and $38 billion in 7-year notes on Thursday.

Elsewhere, 100 underperformed due to a near 7% drop in shares of Barclays after the UK lender cut its full-year guidance on net interest margins despite beating quarterly profit forecast.

In euro zone banking, UniCredit climbed 1.8% as the Italian bank posted a bigger-than-expected annual rise of 36% in its third-quarter profit.

Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:

* Flash October business surveys from United States and around the world via S&P Global; Richmond Fed Oct manufacturing survey, Philadelphia Fed Oct service sector survey

* U.S. corporate earnings: Microsoft, Alphabet, Visa (NYSE: ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), Danaher (NYSE: ), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: ), Verizon (NYSE: ), General Electric (NYSE: ), NextEra Energy (NYSE: ), Invesco, Fiserv (NYSE: ), HCA Healthcare (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Halliburton (NYSE: ), Dow, Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: ), Spotify (NYSE: ), Dover (NYSE: ), Nucor (NYSE: ), Waste Management (NYSE: ), CoStar, 3M, F5, Chubb (NYSE: ), Paccar (NASDAQ: ), Centene (NYSE: ), Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: ), Archer-Daniels-Midland, RTX, Quest, Pentair (NYSE: ), Synchrony

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is starting to boost defense contractors' revenues, as customers such as the U.S. government restock supplies shipped to Ukraine and countries around Europe arm themselves with an eye on Moscow's aggressions.

U.S. defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ), General Dynamics (NYSE: ) and others expect that existing orders for hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, hundreds of Patriot missile interceptors and a surge in orders for armored vehicles expected in the months ahead will underpin their results in coming quarters.

New contracts to supply Ukraine directly - or backfill U.S. weapons sent to Ukraine - were signed late last year, and now revenue is flowing to the big defense contractors. Lockheed, General Dynamics and RTX all reported better than expected results over the past several days, and executives expect both the conflict in Ukraine and Israel's war with Palestinian militant group Hamas to drive up near-term demand.

""We've gone from 14,000 (artillery) rounds per month to 20,000 very quickly. We're working ahead of schedule to accelerate that production capacity up to 85,000, even as high as 100,000 rounds per month,"" Jason Aiken, General Dynamics' chief financial officer, said on a call with Wall Street analysts on Wednesday.

""And I think the Israel situation is only going to put upward pressure on that demand.""

The General Dynamics' Combat Systems unit, which makes armored vehicles, tanks and the artillery Ukraine uses, saw its revenue rise almost 25% versus the same period a year ago.

RTX, which makes AMRAAM rockets used in Ukraine, said on Tuesday's earnings call with Wall Street analysts it has received $3 billion of orders since Russia's February 2022 invasion that are related to replenishing Ukraine and U.S. war stocks, and the company expects more.

Third-quarter sales for Northrop Grumman (NYSE: )'s Defense Systems segment rose 6% on high demand for ammunition and rocket motors used in guided multiple-launch rocket systems (GMLRS), which play a crucial role in supporting Ukraine's defense efforts against Russian forces.

This is part of a global trend. Sweden's Saab raised its full-year sales outlook on Thursday on the back of strong defense demand and Germany's Rheinmetall said third-quarter profit jumped on strong demand for weapons and ammunition.

During his latest request for $106 billion in new funds for Ukraine, Israel, the Indo-Pacific region and border enforcement, U.S. President Joe Biden on Oct. 20 said some of the supplemental request would go to companies that backfill production of U.S. weapons sent abroad. Biden mentioned Patriot missiles made in Arizona, and ""artillery shells manufactured in 12 states across the country,"" naming Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas.

To be sure, executives from several defense firms at a recent trade show cautioned that a lack of skilled labor and supply chain issues continue to hamper companies' capacity to fill orders.

""The supply chain, to be completely candid with you, remains, and I think we expect to remain what I call fragile,"" General Dynamics's Aiken said on the earnings call, as the company said it was cutting its forecast for 2023 business jet deliveries. ""I don't think that's going to get back to what we saw pre-pandemic for the foreseeable future.""

Lockheed on Oct. 17 said supply and labor disruptions are affecting divisions like aeronautics, which makes the advanced F-35 fighter jet, due to the need for processor assemblies, solid-rocket motors, castings and forgings.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ukraine-war-orders-starting-to-boost-revenues-for-big-us-defense-contractors-3211551,0.058,0.87,0.072,0.7269

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The Norwegian defence ministry on Tuesday said it had agreed a new collaboration with U.S. based RTX unit Raytheon (NYSE: ) and Norway's Kongsberg Gruppen on further development of the NASAMS surface-to-air missile system.

""We need to strengthen and further expand air defence to better protect civilian and military targets against airborne threats,"" Norwegian Defence Minister Bjorn Arild Gram said in a statement.

NASAMS is among the weapons systems donated by Western nations to Ukraine following Russia's invasion.

""The war in Ukraine has demonstrated how crucial air defence is in war,"" Gram said.

The new agreement is intended to ensure the NASAMS missile system keeps pace with evolving threats, the ministry added.

The Norwegian government plans to submit two air defence projects for parliamentary approval this autumn in its forthcoming 2023 state budget revisions, the ministry said.

The two projects will acquire missiles for NASAMS air defence, and re-acquire donated main components for NASAMS, respectively, according to the ministry.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/raytheon-kongsberg-to-further-develop-nasams-missile-system-norway-says-3214868,0.043,0.815,0.142,0.936

RTX +1.03% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

RTX (NYSE: RTX), formerly known as Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: ), has seen a significant recovery in its share price following a challenging period due to engine defects in its Pratt & Whitney unit. Despite the ongoing issues, the company's management has assured investors that they are effectively handling the crisis, leading to a 13.1% rise in RTX's shares in October, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The majority of these gains came after the company's third-quarter earnings presentation on October 24.

CEO Greg Hayes reported substantial progress on the Pratt & Whitney issue during the Q3 presentation, without adjusting the estimated cost for repairs. This reassurance contributed to the recent uptick in RTX's share price, which had experienced an annual drop of 20%.

In addition to managing the engine defect crisis, RTX also exceeded Wall Street's Q3 estimates and announced a backlog of orders worth $190 billion. The company has further bolstered investor confidence by repurchasing $1.4 billion worth of stock in Q3 and announcing a $10 billion accelerated share-repurchase program. This program will be funded partly through new debt and the sale of its cybersecurity business for $1.3 billion.

Despite concerns over Pratt & Whitney's future business due to limited alternatives and expected management distraction until 2024, RTX continues to be an attractive investment option. The company's defense and commercial aerospace assets, combined with the Pentagon's missile demand and airlines' need for new aircraft, contribute to its appeal.

The Pratt & Whitney engine issue was first disclosed by RTX back in July, indicating that some engines required a costly fix. Since then, the company has been actively working towards rectifying this significant defect at one of the world's largest aircraft engine manufacturers.
