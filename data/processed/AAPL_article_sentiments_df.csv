Shares of Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: ) are down 2.7% in pre-open trading Thursday after Barclays downgraded the stock citing a lack of catalyst in the RF space.

Barclays analysts downgraded the stock to Equal Weight from Overweight while maintaining a $115 price target.

""We see few catalysts in the RF space into next year and downgrade SWKS to EW as the stock closes the valuation gap with QRVO and approaches our $115 PT,"" they commented.

The analysts note the Apple (NASDAQ: ) content story was flat this year due to a WiFi 6E boost but losing 2.4GHz to Murata (TYO: ). Meanwhile, the Android market is still underperforming, offering little excitement. There might be a content story for the iPhone 16, but it remains unseen. They question the RF growth story with 5G becoming mature.

Initially, they preferred SWKS over Qorvo (NASDAQ: ) based on valuation, but the gap has narrowed since their SWKS upgrade on 1/23/23 (SWKS +11% and QRVO +3%).",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/skyworks-solutions-falls-as-barclays-downgrades-on-lack-of-catalsyts-432SI-3129774,0.04,0.879,0.081,0.8253

Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest earnings reports you may have missed this week and how analysts responded: numbers out of Tesla, Netflix, IBM, and Goldman Sachs.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news in rapid fire. Never be left in the dust again.

Tesla

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) late Wednesday earnings of $0.91 per share - surpassing the $0.79 Wall Street consensus - on better-than-expected revenue of $24.93, and margins were also less bad than feared.

Still, shares sank 9.7% in Thursday trading.

Excluding regulatory credits, gross margins - which have been closely watched following recent price cuts on Tesla's electric vehicles - fell 6.8% to 18.2% in Q2 from the prior year, better than analysts' estimates of 16.9%.

The price cuts helped the EV giant boost its installed base and rake in new customers, with vehicle deliveries surging 86% to 466,140 EVs in Q2, marking a record quarter for the company.

Wedbush called the move a ""smart strategy,"" saying after the report that the price cuts ""have been in a homerun success in China, Europe, and the US… In a nutshell, we view Tesla where Apple was in the 2008/2009 period as Cupertino was just starting to monetize its services and golden ecosystem with the Street not seeing the broader golden vision at the time.""

Needham and Company reiterated its Hold rating due to valuation, adding that it leans ""more bullish when thinking about TSLA's positioning vs legacy [original equipment manufacturer] peers.""

Goldman Sachs said the report was ""solid"" but that headwinds remain, reiterating its Neutral rating on the stock. Bofa also reiterated Neutral given risks from price cuts, increasing competition, and near-term macro considerations - while also noting the positive factors of cost reduction and ""its ability to remain agile.""

Wells Fargo, meanwhile, said Tesla delivered ""a low quality"" EPS beat ""driven mostly by other income.""

Netflix

Netflix (NASDAQ: ) dropped 8.4% on Thursday, following mixed : While EPS of $3.29 came in better than the consensus of $2.84, revenue of $8.19 billion missed the consensus estimate of $8.27B.

The company added 5.9 million paid net subscribers in Q2 as it successfully rolled out paid sharing to more than 100 countries, representing over 80% of its total revenue. Buyside expectations were around 4M net subscriber additions.

Evercore ISI lifted the price target to $550 after ""a mother of a quarter"" and removed its Tactical Underperform rating on the stock. The firm blamed the move lower in shares on expectations correction, and not a fundamental correction, and ""would encourage investors to buy NFLX shares on this (small) pullback.""

BofA, meanwhile, bumped the price target by $35 to $525 per share on Buy-rated NFLX shares. The analysts said the results were ""healthy,"" adding:

Within the Media ecosystem, we believe NFLX’s depth/breadth of content positions them well to withstand the production reductions.

IBM

International Business Machines (NYSE: ) shares rose more than 2% after better-than-expected of $2.18 a share on below-par sales of $15.58B.

IBM said it continues to expect full-year 2023 constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5%. At current foreign exchange rates, currency is expected to be neutral to revenue growth.

UBS reiterated a Sell rating and a $110 per share price target on IBM stock, as the analysts believe the reiterated guidance bears a risk: They say they expect revenue to come in at the low end of the full-year 2023 ""implied"" guidance.

BofA, however, kept its Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target by $8 to $160 per share, saying, ""We believe the turnaround at IBM ([revenue] growth and [free cash flow] improvement) will continue. The company has a defensive portfolio, attractive dividend yield and an underappreciated AI portfolio.""

Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) on Wednesday said plunged 60% to $3.08 in Q2, missing estimates, on lower revenue of $10.89B that squeaked past consensus.

Still, shares ticked up by 1% in Wednesday trading.

The results were attributed to one-off charges related to the banking giant's home improvement lending group GreenSky and losses on its consumer and real estate loan portfolios. Company top brass had already previously warned that this would be a challenging quarter.

Investment banking fees also dropped by 20% to $1.43B, which trading revenue from fixed income, currency, and commodities slipped by more than a fourth.

Like some of its banking rivals, Goldman's investment and trading business has suffered from a slowdown in dealmaking followed by a string of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes that have put pressure on the U.S. economy.

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the biggest headlines out of tech this week: Tesla and Netflix drop on Q2, but analysts are bullish; Taiwan Semiconductor slides on a warning; and Wall Street cheers Microsoft's newly unveiled pricing.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Tesla

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) shares took a dive this past week as investors fretted over the EV maker's recent price cuts to boost volumes and combat intensifying competition in the electric vehicle market. The decision pushed up to a record high of $24.93 billion during the three-month period.

But the move also weighed on its gross profit margin from automotive operations, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, which dropped to 18.2% from 18.8% in the first quarter and 26.2% last year. Although that decline was not as large as many analysts had expected, Tesla's stock still slumped after chief executive Elon Musk later suggested that more price reductions could be coming this year.

As far as the headline numbers go, Tesla reported EPS of $0.91 on revenue of $24.93 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.79 cents on revenue of $24.29B.

The price cuts helped the company boost its installed base and rake in new customers, with deliveries surging 86% to 466,140, marking a record quarter for the company.

Wedbush called the move a ""smart strategy,"" saying after the report that the price cuts ""have been in a homerun success in China, Europe, and the US… In a nutshell, we view Tesla where Apple was in the 2008/2009 period as Cupertino was just starting to monetize its services and golden ecosystem with the Street not seeing the broader golden vision at the time.""

Needham and Company reiterated its Hold rating due to valuation, and both BofA and Goldman Sachs - which said the report was ""solid"" but that headwinds remain - reiterating their Neutral ratings on the stock.

Wells Fargo, meanwhile, said Tesla delivered ""a low quality"" EPS beat ""driven mostly by other income.""

Netflix

Meanwhile, Netflix's (NASDAQ: ) crackdown on password sharing between users - and its cheaper ad-supported tier - appear to be working, with the company seeing a ""low"" number of cancellations and adding 5.9 million subscribers in Q2 - well above Wall Street estimates.

However, this trend was overshadowed by softer-than-anticipated of $8.2B, even as EPS came in at a far better-than-expected $3.29 (vs. estimates for $2.84). Netflix's third-quarter projection of $8.5B for the top-line figure missed forecasts as well.

Co-CEO Greg Peters warned investors that returns from all of these initiatives would take ""several quarters"" to materialize.

Shares in Netflix took a slide, ending the week down 4% to $427.50.

But Evercore ISI lifted the price target to $550 after what it called ""a mother of a quarter"" and removed its Tactical Underperform rating on the stock. The firm blamed the move lower in shares on expectations correction, and not a fundamental correction, and ""would encourage investors to buy NFLX shares on this (small) pullback.""

BofA, meanwhile, bumped the price target by $35 to $525 per share on Buy-rated NFLX shares. The analysts said the results were ""healthy,"" adding:

Within the Media ecosystem, we believe NFLX’s depth/breadth of content positions them well to withstand the production reductions.

Taiwan Semiconductor

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: ), or TSMC, on Thursday logged a higher-than-expected profit on some resilience in chip demand, but warned that a boom in artificial intelligence will not be enough to offset a broader industry downturn.

The New York-traded stock took a quick fall after the results, with American depositary receipts finishing the week down 7.1% to $97.25.

The firm - which is the world’s largest contract chipmaker, and also a key supplier to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) - said net Q2 earnings per share fell 23% to 7.01 Taiwan dollars (US$1 = T$31.07), or US$1.14 per ADR. The per-ADR figure came in easily above expectations for $1.07, per analysts polled by Investing.com.

While the year-on-year decline in profit was partially due to a strong performance last year, it also reflects a slowdown in semiconductor demand through 2023 amid rising interest rates and worsening global economic conditions.

Profitability is expected to worsen in the coming quarter, with the chipmaker's gross profit margin set to drop to 51.5% to 53.5% in the third quarter from 54.1% in the second quarter, while operating profit margin is also expected to decline to between 38% and 40% from 42%.

The firm said that it faced increased headwinds from a broader economic downturn, which was keeping chip demand subdued after a bumper 2022. TSMC also struck a less optimistic note on an artificial intelligence-driven boost to chip demand than some of its peers.

Following the results, research firm CFRA trimmed the company's rating to Buy from the prior Strong Buy.

Microsoft

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) said 365 Copilot users would be charged $30 per month for Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard, and Business Premium when generally available.

After the announcement Tuesday - with higher-than-expected pricing for a very widely used product - Microsoft shares rocketed to a record high for the session.

Analysts were generally bullish on the news as well.

Barclays, for instance, called the move ""a major next step for MSFT’s AI monetization. We think the price uplift (53% over E5) is at the upper end of investors’ expectations and should drive shares.” Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) similarly said that the pricing ""represents a significant step-up to existing license costs.""

BofA, meanwhile, estimated this to represent a $1.52B opportunity based on its estimate of 422 million Office 365 subscribers and anticipation of 1% penetration into that user base. It also believes that ""M365 Copilot’s ability to parse through relevant business data"" is a ""critical differentiator to existing AI products.""

Mizuho was also very positive, writing:

We remain confident that MSFT's growth opportunities over the medium term and beyond are greater than many realize, and this includes significant Generative AI monetization. And among June-quarter companies about to report, MSFT remains our top pick. We reiterate our Buy rating and raise our PT to $420 (was $390).

After Tuesday's surge, shares retreated and ultimately ended down fractionally for the week to $343.77.

AAPL +0.68% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

At least two Wall Street analysts raised their Apple (NASDAQ: ) price targets as the company prepares results for its fiscal third quarter after the market close on Thursday, August 3.

Deutsche Bank analysts hiked the price target by $30 to $210 per share and expect FQ3 and FQ4 results and guidance, respectively, to be “in line with or slightly above current DB/Street estimates, as our recent checks and third-party data suggest upside to iPhone, Mac and Services.”

“While the recovery in global smartphone demand is below expectations, it appears that the premium market (and hence Apple) is less impacted. In addition, the build ahead of the new iPhone launch appears to be on track, and we see the potential for iPhone units to grow y/y in CY23 (vs. Street expectations of down ~5% y/y). We also believe there is upside potential to EPS from FX (that has negatively impacted revenue growth and gross margins) and component pricing (given AAPL built strategic inventory last quarter),” they said in a note.

While some of these upside catalysts are already priced into the AAPL stock, the analysts continue to see further upside.

“Despite higher valuation, we continue to view AAPL favorably given its high quality of earnings and strong balance sheet,” they concluded.

Similarly, Wells Fargo analysts also bumped the PT to $225 per share as they expect the Cupertino-based titan to report better-than-expected EPS figures.

“We think Apple's services growth will reaccelerate in 2H2023 (e.g., Data.AI est. iOS spend +6% in 1H23). More importantly, recent comments made by Bob Iger (Disney CEO) regarding ESPN moving to DTC amid an accelerating shift away from linear — a move that will include 'strategic partners' — has left investors very interested in Apple TV+ expansion in sports and/or overall,” they wrote.

PARIS (Reuters) -France's antitrust watchdog said on Tuesday it had issued a statement of objection against Apple (NASDAQ: ), citing concerns the U.S. technology company could have breached regulations linked to the use of iPhone user data for advertising purposes.

The watchdog is concerned Apple might ""abuse its dominant position by implementing discriminatory, non-objective and non-transparent conditions for the use of user data for advertising purposes"", it said in a statement.

The statement triggers an antitrust procedure during which the company will be able to express its point of view, the watchdog said.

Apple denied the allegation. The mechanism ""gives users more control by requiring all apps to ask permission before tracking them"", the company said in an e-mailed statement, adding it will ""continue to engage constructively"" with the French regulator.

Four French online advertising industry groups filed an antitrust complaint in 2020 against Apple over changes the company made to privacy features when it started to ask iPhone owners whether they were ready to allow apps to gather data used to define and send targeted ads, called App Tracking Transparency (ATT).

The feature lead to revenue declines for publishers, industry lobby groups said.

The four associations - IAB France, MMAF, SRI and UDECAM - said the changes brought by Apple did not meet European Union privacy rules, citing the fact that while the opt-in mechanism applied for third-party developers, Apple's own apps did not include it.

""Apple’s apps do not show an ATT prompt because they do not track, meaning they do not link user or device data with user or device data collected from other companies’ apps, websites, or offline properties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, nor do they share user or device data with data brokers,"" Apple said.

""Apple holds its advertising business to a higher standard of privacy than it requires of any other developer,"" the company added.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/french-antitrust-watchdog-issues-statement-of-objection-against-apple-3133489,0.035,0.943,0.022,-0.6992

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's export-dependent economy likely returned to growth in the second quarter thanks to resilient domestic consumption although exports remained weak, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.

Gross domestic product (GDP) likely expanded 0.8% in the April-June period versus a year earlier, the poll of 22 economists showed. GDP had contracted 2.87% year-on-year in the first quarter, with the economy slipping into recession.

The economists' forecasts for preliminary GDP data due on Friday varied widely from a contraction of 0.2% to growth of 2.0%.

Taiwan's exports fell more than expected in June, slumping the most in almost 14 years, with the government predicting a return to growth may not occur until November.

Second quarter exports dropped 16.9% compared with the same period last year, an improvement on the first quarter's annual contraction of 19.2%.

""Domestic consumption has not been bad,"" said analyst Woods Chen of Yuanta Investment Consulting.

""The decline in exports could lessen each month in the third quarter. We expect the central bank will not raise interest rates in September,"" he added.

The government said in May it expects full-year 2023 growth of 2.04%, its slowest pace in nearly eight years and lower than the 2.45% growth for 2022.

Bank DBS last week last week downgraded its full year GDP growth outlook for Taiwan to just 0.5% from a previous 1.6% citing poor export prospects, though upgraded its forecast for 2025 to 3.5% from 2.8%.

The economy in China, Taiwan's largest export market, grew 6.3% in the second quarter, coming in under analyst forecasts, as demand weakened at home and abroad, with the post-COVID momentum faltering rapidly.

Taiwan is a key hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), and home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC).

Taiwan's preliminary figures will be released in a statement with minimal commentary. Revised figures will be released a few weeks later, with more details and forward-looking forecasts.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC: )' mobile chief said Samsung (KS: ) is ""going in the right direction"" in China, the world's largest mobile market, as it seeks to raise its lagging market share by boosting premium offerings and ties with local content firms.

Third-party data shows the world's largest smartphone maker is making small gains in its single-digit market share in China, said TM Roh, head of mobile experience at Samsung Electronics.

""We are making efforts to reach Chinese consumers with products that fit the China market, through software optimisation that fits the China market, and I think the results are coming out little by little,"" Roh told reporters this week.

Roh said Samsung's mobile business set the goal of ""recovering"" the China market via premium products and services like its new flagship foldable phones Samsung launched on Wednesday, as well as strengthening partnerships with local content firms.

Samsung, which was the biggest smartphone vendor in China in 2013 with about a 20% market share, saw that plummet to 1% in 2018 then dip further below, overshadowed by Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Chinese vendors like Vivo, Oppo and Honor. But by March, Samsung had recovered a 1.1% market share, according to Counterpoint data.

The current trend of premium smartphone demand outpacing demand for more bare-bones models is likely to continue for some time, Roh said, as ""mobile users' device replacement cycles are getting longer and longer in the global market.""

""I think they now decide buying the right product and using it longer is much more satisfactory and advantageous to their experience than replacing quickly with a new product.""

As for the foldable phones Samsung pioneered in 2019, Roh said Samsung was working toward a lower-priced foldable model to widen its customer base, including in China and India.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A resilient U.S. economy and expectations of a nearing peak in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tightening cycle are emboldening stock investors, even as worries persist over rising valuations and the potential for inflation to rebound.

The is up nearly 19% this year after gaining around 1% in the past week. It has risen nearly 10 percentage points since June 1, over which time the U.S. government avoided a debt ceiling default and consumer prices cooled, while growth stayed resilient.

One key factor driving stocks higher has been the view that the economy is moving towards a so-called Goldilocks scenario of ebbing consumer prices and strong growth that many believe is a healthy backdrop for stocks.

That view gained further traction in the past week, when Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank's staff no longer forecasts a U.S. recession and that inflation had a shot of returning to its 2% target without high levels of job losses.

Policymakers raised rates by another 25 basis points to their highest level since 2007 at the central bank's July 26 meeting and left the door open to another increase in September.

""The market has fully accepted the narrative that it wanted, which is Goldilocks. Until we see some set of data that scares them it's hard to see how that changes,"" said Bob Kalman, senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital.

At the same time, investors believe the Fed is unlikely to deliver much more of the monetary policy tightening that shook markets last year. Futures markets on Friday priced a nearly 73% chance that rates don’t rise above current levels through the end of the year, according to CME’s FedWatch tool, up from 24% a month ago.

A test of the economy comes next week, when the U.S. reports employment numbers for July. While comparatively strong employment data has been a driver of this year’s stock rally, signs that the economy is growing at too rapid a pace could spark worries that the Fed will need to raise rates more than expected.

""For markets to continue to trade higher, the soft landing must be a soft landing, not a reacceleration, because if housing and consumer spending accelerate from here, the Fed will have to raise rates a lot more,"" wrote Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management (NYSE: ).

Kalman, of Miramar Capital, believes there’s a growing chance the Fed may need to raise rates beyond their current 5.50% threshold and hold them there for longer than expected, an outcome he worries could dampen the economy and hurt risk assets.

""It's a 50-50 chance that we'll get Goldilocks or we'll get a stronger downturn,"" he said.

Many are also assessing the durability of a rally in tech stocks, which has been fueled in part by excitement over developments in artificial intelligence. The tech-heavy is up nearly 44% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 information technology sector has gained nearly 46%.

Optimistic forecasts from Meta Platforms and results from Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) earlier this week bolstered the case for those who believe megacaps’ lofty valuations are justified. Some smaller companies have delivered as well, with shares of streaming device maker Roku (NASDAQ: ) Inc soaring on Friday after it gave an upbeat quarterly revenue forecast.

Still, some investors have been looking outside of tech stocks for further gains, wary of rising valuations. The S&P 500 tech sector now trades at 28.2 times forward earnings, from 19.6 at the start of the year.

Burns McKinney, senior portfolio manager at NJF Investment Group, owns shares of Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) but has been adding to dividend-paying positions in healthcare, financials, and energy in anticipation that megacap names start to falter.

For megacap stocks, ""the risk-reward is not as good as it was a quarter ago,"" he said.

Others believe the rally in equities is due for a pause. Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said he wouldn't be surprised to see the S&P 500 fall 5% or more in the next month or two as investors take profits on recent gains.Yet he also believes stocks are in the ""early stages"" of their recovery after falling into a bear market last year. ""There’s always a concern with too much optimism, but longer term a sort of consolidation here speaks to a positive market going out,"" he said.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/hopes-of-goldilocks-economy-rate-peak-buoy-us-stocks-3137988,0.035,0.891,0.074,0.9774

(Reuters) -Wall Street and global stocks edged up on Monday while oil prices gained and the dollar was little changed, as traders looked ahead to corporate earnings and a key employment report due this week.

The rose 0.28% to 35,560.19, the gained 0.15% to 4,589.15 and the added 0.21% to 14,346.02.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) both report on Thursday, while other well-known names with results due include Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: ), Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ).

European shares gained modestly after euro zone inflation fell further in July seeing that most measures of underlying price growth also eased. Markets took this as a comforting sign for the European Central Bank (ECB) as it considers ending a brutal string of interest rate hikes.

The pan-European index rose by 0.12%, a second consecutive monthly gain. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.15%.

The modest gains came despite China's manufacturing activity falling for a fourth straight month in July, as demand remained weak at home and abroad, official surveys showed on Monday.

""Markets are treating information with a lot more sensitivity and people are looking into new information with a detailed eye,"" said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.

EYES ON THE HORIZON

Economic indicators that investors will be watching this week include the U.S. ISM surveys on manufacturing and services, as well as the July payrolls report.

""Data out this week should remain superficially consistent with the 'soft landing' narrative,"" Citi market strategists wrote in a note. ""But the potential return to upside surprises to job growth would raise questions about whether slowing inflation can coexist with tight labor markets.""

All three main U.S. indexes have posted recent gains as signs of cooling inflation and a resilient economy have eased investor sentiment about the economy surviving amid higher rates for longer.

Upbeat quarterly earnings from megacap growth companies including Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms as well as chipmakers Intel (NASDAQ: ) and Lam Research (NASDAQ: ) have also boosted investor sentiment.

Almost 30% of the S&P 500 reports results this week. The index is now up nearly 20% for the year.

Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) Investment Institute's head of global investment strategy, urged caution given the potential for a weaker economy, slower disinflation and narrower corporate profits.

""This year's impressive equity rally has been driven by strong sentiment, without either the earnings growth or the directional improvement in economic data to justify current market multiples and valuations,"" Christopher wrote in a note.

RISING RATES

Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee on Monday said the U.S. central bank is ""walking the line pretty well"" on bringing inflation down without causing a recession, and will watch the data as September approaches to judge if more monetary tightening may be appropriate.

The Bank of England is widely expected to raise rates by at least a quarter point. Traders cut bets on a continuing rally in the pound by the most since mid-June ahead of the Bank of England rate decision on Thursday.

Sterling has surged 24% from a record low of $1.033 against the dollar in September after a disastrous budget, hitting a 15-month high of $1.314 in mid-July.

The dollar edged higher on Monday after a survey from the Federal Reserve showed U.S. banks reported tighter credit standards and weaker loan demand during the second quarter, a sign rising interest rates are having an impact on the economy.

The Japanese yen weakened about 0.8% versus the dollar. Investors continued to digest Friday's decision by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to lift the lid on bond yields in a step away from its ultra-easy policies.

Japanese 10-year yields surged to a nine-year high up to 0.6% on Monday, and toward the new cap of 1.0%.

U.S. Treasury yields were marginally lower, with investors waiting for employment data to assess the impact of the Fed's monetary tightening campaign on the economy. The 10-year was down 1 basis point at 3.961%.

In commodities, gold prices rose, putting them on track for their best month in four, helped by a weaker dollar and expectations that major global central banks are nearing a peak with interest rate hikes. added 0.3% to $1,965 an ounce [GOL/]

Oil prices rallied to a fresh three-month high and recorded their steepest monthly gains since January 2022, supported by signs of tightening global supply and rising demand through the rest of this year.

Apple's (NASDAQ: ) iPhone sell-through in the June quarter was down 1%, partially offset by 7% growth in China, UBS analysts said in a note Tuesday.

The analysts, who have a Neutral rating and $195 price target on AAPL shares, explained that iPhone sell-through in the month of June came in at 15.4 million units, up 2% YoY against a 9% decline in June 2022, resulting in a 1% decline in the quarter. In the US, sell-through was down 14%.

""Europe sell through declined ~1%, the 19th straight monthly decline. However, given easing comps in Europe (+190bps MoM) in July, we expect unit sell-through to be flattish to modestly up in this region next month.""

(Reuters) -Wall Street finished lower on Wednesday, with the and down for a second straight day as investors took profits on five months of gains a day after rating agency Fitch cut the U.S. government's credit rating.

Fitch downgraded the United States to AA+ from AAA late on Tuesday, citing expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years as well as growing government debt. Fitch was the second major agency to cut the country's rating. In 2011 Standard & Poor's stripped the country of its triple-A grade.

Reaction to the news pushed major indexes lower, with the S&P 500 recording its biggest daily percentage drop since April 25. It was also the first session since May 23 in which the benchmark declined by more than 1%.

Still, several major brokerages said the downgrade was unlikely to result in a sustained drag on U.S. financial markets, noting the economy was now stronger than it was when S&P cut its rating in 2011.

July was the fifth straight month of gains for the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, driven by better-than-expected earnings and hopes of a soft landing for the U.S. economy.

However, with markets entering a seasonally slow August, the Fitch downgrade offered an opportunity for investors to take a breather.

""Sometimes it's healthy to have this digestion in the market, as it brings down valuations a bit and it allows for dip-buying,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial (NASDAQ: ) in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Rate-sensitive megacap stocks, including Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms and Apple (NASDAQ: ), tumbled, as the yield on U.S. rose to its highest in nearly nine months. [US/]

Tech stocks get premium valuations because investors expect profit growth, and many fear high interest rates could slow the economy and dent that growth. Higher rates can make interest-bearing bonds an attractive alternative to stocks for some risk-averse investors, and projected company cash flows are worth less in current dollars when interest rates rise.

The technology index, dropping 2.6%, was also the worst performer of the 11 major S&P sectors, with nine in total ending the day lower.

Yields being above 4% is ""not what the market wants to see"", according to LPL's Krosby, who also predicted investors will soon look beyond Fitch's downgrade and turn their focus to big tech company earnings due after the close on Thursday.

""The market is now going to focus on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Apple tomorrow afternoon, and then on the payroll report on Friday, and we'll say goodbye to Fitch,"" Krosby said.

The fell 348.16 points, or 0.98%, to 35,282.52, the S&P 500 lost 63.34 points, or 1.38%, to 4,513.39 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 310.47 points, or 2.17%, to 13,973.45.

Meanwhile, the ADP National Employment report showed private payrolls increased more than expected in July, pointing to continued labor market resilience that could shield the economy from a recession.

Despite lingering fears of a recession, corporate America has continued to perform well. With around two-thirds of the S&P 500 having already reported, 79.9% have posted earnings above analysts' expectations, per Refinitiv I/B/E/S.

This puts the quarter on track for the highest earnings beat rate since the third quarter of 2021, per the data provider.

On the earnings front, CVS Health Corp (NYSE: ) gained 3.3% after beating Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit, and Emerson (NYSE: ) climbed 3.8% after the industrial software firm raised its annual profit outlook.

Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) slipped 7% over concerns its targets for an artificial intelligence (AI) ramp-up may be too ambitious. The worries overshadowed the chip designer forecasting an upbeat finish to the year.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.88 billion shares, compared with the 10.79 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

By Carolina Mandl

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A highly awaited inflation report and elevated bond yields offer the latest test to a U.S. stock rally that has delivered hefty gains this year.

The benchmark is up 16.6% year to date, fueled by an improving economic outlook, excitement over developments in artificial intelligence and signs that the Federal Reserve is close to ending its market-bruising U.S. interest rate hikes.

Stocks' near-term trajectory, however, may depend on whether next week's inflation report shows consumer prices remaining subdued. Investors are also closely watching the path of Treasury yields, which rattled equity markets in recent days by rising to fresh year highs. The S&P 500 fell 2.27% this week, its biggest weekly decline since March 10.

""After a massive run-up in equities ... any sort of blip in terms of any of the macro data (is) probably going to be a reason for people to take profits,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist and portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers.

While consumer prices have not been rising as fast lately, some investors worry stubborn inflation may force the Fed to leave rates at current levels longer than expected. The U.S. reports consumer price data on Aug. 10.

On Friday, U.S. employment data showed the economy maintained a moderate pace of job growth. Yet wages grew at a faster-than-expected annual clip of 4.4%. Many fear that is too high to be consistent with the Fed's 2% inflation target.

Janasiewicz of Natixis said a stronger-than-expected consumer price reading next week could spark a decline of up to 5% in the S&P 500. He said such a drop would be “healthy” given the index's big runup this year.

Other investors have been taking profits. Concerns over rising stock valuations pushed Aaron Chan, a managing partner at equity hedge fund Recurve Capital, to trim stakes in shares of companies including Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), which is up 68% this year, and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE: ), up 47%.

The S&P 500 is trading at about 19.5 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, much pricier than its long-term average of about 15.6 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream.

Rising global prices for oil and food, which the Fed's rate increases do little to control, may have more sway on inflation in coming months, said Tim Murray, a capital markets strategist at T. Rowe Price.

Prices for were on track for their sixth straight week of gains, up roughly 17% in that period on signs of tightening global supply and rising demand.

""As long as CPI remains flat to trending down, the market will accept it thoroughly,"" said Ann Miletti, Allspring's head of active equity. ""If we do see upticks, it is really dependent on where the upticks are and whether or not investors believe they're temporary in nature.""

Miletti is growing more bullish on corners of the market that have underperformed, including small cap stocks.

A stronger-than-expected inflation number next week could also boost Treasury yields further. Yields, which move inversely to bond prices, spiked this week following a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Fitch and on the prospect of a flood of Treasury supply in the third quarter. The benchmark 10-year yield fell sharply after Friday's jobs report but remained above 4%, a level last seen in November 2022.

Rising yields on Treasuries, viewed as among the world's safest investments because they are backed by the U.S. government, can dull the allure of stocks. Projected company cash flows are also worth less in current dollars when interest rates rise.

""The move in the above the 4% level will likely act as a headwind to further expansion in already lofty equity valuations,"" Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services, wrote this week.

There is still plenty of good news to keep the rally going. Earnings from Wall Street heavyweights Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) have exceeded analysts expectations, though disappointing earnings from Apple (NASDAQ: ) sent the stock tumbling 4.8% on Friday.

More broadly, more than 79% of S&P 500 companies have beaten estimates for the second quarter so far, the highest beat rate since the third quarter of 2021, data from Refinitiv I/B/E/S showed.

The past week also saw analysts from BofA Global Research and JPMorgan (NYSE: ) revise their forecasts for a U.S. recession.

Still, some market participants believe investors may have to endure some near-term turbulence.

""Our expectation is that the market takes some time to digest the strong year-to-date gains and moves into a choppy period,"" Lerner said.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/inflation-report-bond-yields-in-focus-as-us-stocks-rally-pauses-3145938,0.03,0.897,0.073,0.9765

(Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Friday after a report of slowing U.S. labor market growth, and all three major indexes posted weekly losses as investors braced for more possible downside surprises a day after disappointing earnings from Apple (NASDAQ: ).

Apple's shares AAPL.O fell 4.8%, its biggest daily percentage decline since Sept. 29, 2022 that dented the by about 16 points the day after the iPhone maker forecast a continued slide in sales.

A partial counterweight to Apple for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq was Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ). Its shares AMZN.O rose 8.3% the day after the online retailer issued an upbeat third-quarter outlook. Amazon's rise were an 11-point positive for the S&P 500.

""Those big bellwether companies really have the potential to cause investor jitters even though overall the trajectory and direction of both the economy and corporate earnings seems to be positive moving into August."" Said Greg Bassuk, chief executive officer of AXS Investments in New York.

The trading session was choppy, with the indexes rising in the morning, then wavering before turning negative.

On the bond market, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury edged lower in afternoon trading.

""There's still a lot of uncertainty around geopolitical concerns, Ukraine war, (and) China issues”, said Bassuk. He said Friday's decline was ""more about investors resetting and positioning for potential downside surprises.""

The Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added 187,000 jobs in July. Data for June additions was revised lower to 185,000 jobs, from 209,000 reported previously.

Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in July, unchanged from the previous month, exceeding expectations, taking the year-on-year increase in wages to 4.4%.

The yield on the 10-year benchmark Treasury note dipped after the jobs data, partly boosting some megacap stocks.

Shares of other big tech companies, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) MSFT.O and Snowflake SNOW.N rose 0.3% and 3.5% respectively after Amazon's cloud business segment beat sales estimates.

The .DJI fell 150.27 points, or 0.43%, to 35,065.62, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 23.86 points, or 0.53%, to 4,478.03 and the .IXIC dropped 45.18 points, or 0.32%, to 13,914.54.

The weekly percentage declines for the S&P and Nasdaq were the biggest since March, with some investors taking profits after five months of gains due to economic data, disappointing earnings and rising Treasury yields.

Of the 422 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported quarterly earnings as of Friday, 79.1% have surpassed autonomous expectations, according to Refinitiv data.

Carl Icahn-owned investment firm Icahn Enterprises IEP.O shed 23.3%. The company halved its quarterly payout, months after short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of operating a ""Ponzi-like"" structure to pay dividends.

Fortinet (NASDAQ: ) FTNT.O tumbled 25.1% after the cybersecurity firm cut its annual revenue forecast as spending from enterprise clients remained tight amid a turbulent economy.

Shares of Tupperware (NYSE: ) TUP.N, known for its plastic airtight storage containers and bowls, rallied 35.5% after the company finalized an agreement with its lenders to restructure its debt obligations in an effort to turn around the business.

Amgen (NASDAQ: ) AMGN.O added 5.5% after it reported a higher quarterly profit on strong sales of its cholesterol, osteoporosis and other drugs.

DraftKings (NASDAQ: )' DKNG.O shares rose 5.8% after the sports-betting firm raised its fiscal year 2023 revenue outlook.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.39 billion shares, compared with the 10.87 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.14-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Amazon smashes Q2 estimates

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) surged 8% Friday after the tech giant blew out of the water and nicely topped guidance revenue, riding high off strength in its cloud business.

Amazon said its profit came to $0.65 for the quarter - $0.30 better than the consensus of $0.35 - on revenue of $134.4 billion, which also surpassed the $131.45B average analyst estimate.

Amazon Web Services, which comprised 70% of its Q2 operating profit, jumped 12% to $22.1B - ahead of estimates for 10.2% growth. The company said this surge came as customers ""started shifting from cost optimization to new workload deployment.""

For the third quarter, the company expects revenue of $138B to $143B vs. estimates for $138.28B.

Bernstein called the print ""a defining moment"" during CEO Andy Jassy's tenure, which started about two years ago, and hiked the company's price target by $20 to $175 per share. Bernstein added:

Amazon fired on all cylinders: AWS finally stabilizing and now a coiled spring; Retail performance hanging in with a weakened consumer; N. American retail margins are back to pre-pandemic levels and accelerating alongside compressing fulfillment windows — impressive; and aggregate operating profits are up and to the right.

BofA said Amazon remains ""our top stock in sector"" given Amazon's retail cost improvement efforts, saying it expects ""several more quarters of margin benefits from increasing retail efficiency."" BofA added that AWS is ""seemingly poised to accelerate"" given the ""end of Cloud spending optimization cycle amidst easing comps.""

Barclays concurred, writing that AWS is ""likely re-accelerating on regular/AI workloads,"" adding that ""retail growth is steady and margins may overshoot the 2018 peak.""

""It's finally time to sit back and enjoy the ride,"" Barclays wrote.

Shares booked a weekly gain of 4.8% gain to $139.57

Apple slumps on iPhone worries

Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) lost 4.8% Friday after the iPhone maker reported its third consecutive quarterly sales drop, even though topped estimates.

iPhone revenue, which makes up nearly half of Apple's total top line, fell to $39.67 billion from $40.67B a year earlier, missing estimates of $39.91B. And revenue overall totaled $81.8B - better than the $81.73 consensus, but down from $83B a year earlier.

Strength in Apple's services business helped offset the soft iPhone sales: Revenue from Apple News, Apple TV+, and iCloud, among other service units, grew to $21.21B from $19.60B a year earlier, ahead of estimates of $20.76B.

As for its bottom line, earnings per share came to $1.26, also topping estimates for $1.19.

Regarding the iPhone softness, in the earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects iPhone and services performance to ""accelerate from the June quarter"" year over year. He also predicted more double-digit declines in Mac and iPad sales, ""particularly on the Mac,"" due to difficult comparisons vs. the prior year.

In fiscal Q3, iPad revenue fell by 20% to $5.79B year-on-year in Q3. missing Wall Street estimates of $6.41B.

Still, given the expected acceleration in iPhone sales and services, as well as the gross margin expansion, Citi opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on AAPL stock.

""Post Jun-Q earnings through new Phone launch the stock historically outperformed NASDAQ 5 out 7 times and S&P500 all 7 times, or 8% on average since 2016,"" Citi wrote in a note.

On the other hand, BofA remains sidelined:

We remain Neutral as positive catalysts of new product introduction and stable iPhones are offset by a potentially weaker consumer spending environment. ...The guidance suggests typical launch timing for iPhones but with the backdrop of a weak US smartphone market we think it’s unlikely that iPhone rev significantly re-accelerates.

Shares ended the week down 7.2% to $181.99.

AMD sees a roller coaster week after Q2

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) shares took a slide on its amid analyst concerns about guidance, but the stock strongly recovered after Morgan Stanley said the selloff was overdone.

AMD's Q2 EPS came in at $0.58 per share, a penny better than consensus, and Q3 guidance also topped consensus - but Bernstein said it fears estimates ""remain too high"" amid optimism around AI ""and the stock... looks a little stretched to us,"" according to Reuters.

Oppenheimer was also cautious, writing, ""We remain sidelined as AMD’s AI strategy proves out.""

Revenue totaled $5.4B, better than the $5.32B analyst expectations, and AMD CEO Lisa Su said the company's AI engagements climbed by more than seven times ""as multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale.""

The stock more than recovered, ending with a 1.6% gain for the week to $115.82, after Morgan Stanley said it sees the stock as a ""significant outperformer"" relative to other chip stocks at current levels. The analyst added:

Guidance for flat y/y servers in 3q - up 15-20% q/q - with clear eyes about the current cloud weakness should be an indication that share gains and the delayed Genoa ramp are in good shape. We expected the stock to be up meaningfully.

Citi, for its part, upgraded AMD to Buy from Neutral immediately after the Q2 results, bumping its price target by $16 to $136 per share.

""We thought AMD’s AI products (MI300) would be margin dilutive and investors would eventually care about the expensive valuation on AMD, and we were wrong on both counts,"" the analysts said.

Qualcomm falls on soft guidance

Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) fell more than 8% Thursday after the company reported underwhelming guidance for the current quarter and delivered mixed amid softer smartphone demand.

The chipmaker reported adjusted EPS of $1.87 on revenue of $8.44 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.81 on revenue of $8.51B.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company guided EPS in the range of $1.80 to $2 - the midpoint of which is below Wall Street estimates for $1.94 - on revenue of between $8.1B to $8.9B, which compares with estimates for $8.77B.

""The midpoint of our fourth quarter fiscal 2023 guidance includes the continued impact of the macroeconomic headwinds, weaker global handset units and channel inventory drawdown,"" the company said.

Deutsche Bank downgraded the QCOM stock to Hold with a price target lowered by $10 to $120 per share. While the company was in line with the analysts' estimates, it was concerned with management's ""soft commentary"" around its December quarter and ""incremental headwinds in 2024.""

CFRA, meanwhile, lifted the price target by $2 to $125 per share on the Hold-rated QCOM stock. The firm wrote:

Although we expect QCOM's under-shipping of true demand is likely to come to an end over the next 3-6 months, we remain wary of QCOM to potentially start losing Apple business by late CY 24.

Qualcomm shares partially recovered on Friday, but ended the week with a 6.4% loss to $121.50.

PayPal plummets on gross profit worries

PayPal (NASDAQ: ) plunged more than 12% Thursday, after edging out top- and bottom-line estimates, on worries regarding its gross profit growth.

PayPal said it earned $1.16 per share in Q2 on revenue of $7.29 billion. Analysts polled by InvestingPro anticipated EPS of $1.15 on revenue of $7.27B.

But the company's total payment volume (TPV), or transaction revenue less transaction expenses and transaction losses, rose just 1% from the prior year.

After the print, Evercore ISI downgraded the stock to In Line from Outperform, saying it sees ""increasing headwinds to revenue and earnings growth"" due to ""intensifying competition, evidenced by the sequential loss of 2.5 million consumer accounts (0.6% of total accounts) combined with nearly 300 basis point of transaction margin pressure.""

The analyst added: ""Without a clear path to year-over-year transaction margin expansion, we see limited scope for earnings outperformance.""

Bernstein also voiced concerns about TPV growth pressures, adding that gross profit (GP) growth ""is essentially the true revenue for the company."" The analyst added:

Transaction GP is a critical health metric, especially because TPV growth is an outcome of many businesses with vastly different gross margins. ... On surface, transaction GP growth looks very weak. Are the gross margin pressures structural or transitory?

In terms of guidance, PayPal expects Q3 adjusted EPS to grow 13% to 14%, to a range of $1.22 to $1.24, on 8% revenue growth to about $7.4B. That compared with Wall Street estimates for EPS and revenue of $1.22 and $7.33B, respectively.

For all of 2023, EPS is expected at $4.95, just above expectations of $4.94.

Shares ultimately lost more than 16% for the week to $62.75.

(Reuters) -Berkshire Hathaway's stock price set a record high on Monday, rising 3.4% after the conglomerate run by billionaire investor Warren Buffett said quarterly operating profit topped $10 billion for the first time.

In its second-quarter earnings report on Saturday, Berkshire said rising interest rates boosted profit from fixed-income investments, including a cash stake that grew to $147.4 billion, while fewer accident claims bolstered Geico car insurance.

That helped offset declining profit at the BNSF railroad, and lower earnings from building products companies such as Clayton Homes as well as consumer businesses such as Forest River recreational vehicles and Duracell batteries.

Buffett's company, based in Omaha, Nebraska, also posted quarterly net income of $35.9 billion, reflecting unrealized gains on investments such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), whose stock price rose 17.6% in the quarter.

Berkshire owned $177.6 billion of the iPhone maker's shares at the end of June.

Class A shares of Berkshire rose $18,320 to $551,920 on Monday, giving Berkshire a market value of about $799 billion.

The shares earlier reached $555,800, surpassing the previous high $544,000 set on March 28, 2022.

Buffett owns about 15% of Berkshire's stock. He passed Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) co-founder Bill Gates on Monday to become the world's fifth-richest person, with a $121.5 billion fortune, according to Forbes magazine.

UBS analyst Brian Meredith (NYSE: ), who rates Berkshire ""buy,"" raised his 12-month price target for the Class A shares to $621,591 from $608,000, calling the stock ""an attractive play in an uncertain macro environment.""

Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Meyer Shields, who rates Berkshire ""market perform,"" raised his price target to $565,000 from $545,000.

Berkshire has never split its Class A shares. Its Class B shares normally trade at about 1/1,500th as much.

In 2023, Berkshire shares have risen 18%, the same as the .

The shares no longer routinely trounce the index as they did when Berkshire was smaller, but over long periods can match or slightly outperform the index with less volatility.

Buffett, 92, has run Berkshire since 1965.

His conglomerate also includes namesake energy, car dealership and real estate brokerage businesses, several manufacturing and industrial businesses, and consumer brands such as Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and See's Candies.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/berkshire-hathaway-stock-scales-record-as-operating-profit-tops-10-billion-3147025,0.02,0.898,0.081,0.9464

(Reuters) - Global video-games market would return to growth in 2023 on the back of strong sales of consoles such as Sony (NYSE: )'s Playstation 5, according to gaming market research firm Newzoo.

Newzoo said it expects industry revenue to rise 2.6% to $187.7 billion in 2023, driven by a 7.4% rise in console sales in the year. Gaming revenue fell 5% in 2022, according to the research firm's data.

""Many highly anticipated delayed titles launched in 2023, with more scheduled for release in H2 (second half), and the supply of new consoles has finally caught up to demand,"" said Newzoo analyst Tom Wijman.

PlayStation maker Sony said in July it expects to sell 25 million units of PS5 consoles this year, a record for any PlayStation devices, as supply chain issues ease.

Market research firm Circana said U.S. consumer spending on video-game hardware was up by 23% in the first half of 2023. But spending on video game content was flat during the period, as gamers stuck with proven franchises such as Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: )'s ""Call of Duty"".

Earlier this month, ""Apex Legends"" publisher Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: ) forecast downbeat net bookings for the September quarter due to lower in-game spending on items such as character skins. However, the company maintained its 2024 bookings forecast as it expects to debut ""EA Sports FC"", its football franchise game, in September.

Newzoo expects mobile games to account for nearly 50% of global gaming revenues in 2023 even as privacy policies of Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ) hamper their monetization.

Newzoo also said cloud gaming, which allows gamers to stream titles directly on devices irrespective of their technical specifications, has the potential to rack up 43.1 million paying users by the end of the year.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/videogaming-revenue-to-grow-26-in-2023-on-console-sales-strength--report-3147605,0.019,0.955,0.026,0.1682

By Lewis Krauskopf

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rising U.S. bond yields are unnerving investors and worsening stocks turbulence as markets confront a pileup of unwelcome news, from last week's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating to revived worries over regional banks.

Surging yields contributed to last year’s plunge in equities, when the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to fight soaring inflation. This year, it’s largely been a different story, with bond yields rising on better-than-expected economic data. The has rallied over 16% from its March lows, despite a roughly 50 basis point increase in the yield on the benchmark note over that time.

That dynamic has changed in recent days, however, as Treasury yields have approached last year’s high while the S&P 500 has fallen 2% from its July peak. One worry is that higher yields on Treasuries, seen as basically risk-free because they are backed by the U.S. government, will make stocks less attractive at a time when equity valuations have ballooned.

Data from BofA Global Research showed one-month correlations between the S&P 500 and the 10-year yield stood at their most negative since 2000, meaning the two assets were once again moving sharply in opposite directions. The bank’s analysts called rising yields ""an underpriced risk"" for the equity market. The S&P 500 fell 2.3% last week, its biggest weekly drop since March.

""The market has looked at the rising yields as consistent with a better economy and what the market perceives as lower recession risk,"" said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services. However, ""If yields continue to move higher, it’s going to be more challenging to get further valuation expansion.""

A series of developments has weighed on the ebullient market mood that had persisted over the last few months. Moody's cut the credit ratings of several small to mid-sized U.S. banks on Monday and said it may downgrade some of the biggest lenders in the United States. That news followed a downgrade from Fitch of the U.S. credit rating last week.

Meanwhile, weak trade data from China undercut hopes for a swift recovery in the world’s second-largest economy, while Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) sold off on Friday following disappointing earnings from the world's most valuable company.

The , which measures investor demand for protection against market swings, shot to its highest level in over two months on Tuesday after falling near an over three-year low late last month.

While markets may have grown complacent heading into August, recent developments ""have kind of slapped people in the face a little and brought the notion that there is risk in markets back to the forefront of people’s minds,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

VALUATION INFLATION

Rising equity valuations have been a concern for investors studying the relationship between bonds and stocks.

As stocks have rallied this year, valuations have become more expensive. The price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 has increased from less than 17 times forward 12-month earnings estimates at the end of 2022, to 19.6 times as of Monday, according to Refinitiv Datastream. The index's long-term average is 15.6.

Meanwhile, the equity risk premium (ERP), which compares the attractiveness of stocks over risk-free government bonds, has been shrinking for most of 2023 and is around its lowest levels in well over a decade.

According to Lerner, of Truist, the current ERP level has historically translated to just a 1.3% average 12-month excess return of the S&P 500 over the 10-year Treasury note.

The markets will have an important test with Thursday's release of the consumer price index inflation data for July. A hotter-than-expected reading stands to raise expectations for more hawkish Fed policy and drive bond yields up further.

Even as the economy has staved off a downturn so far, some investors feel rising interest rates could hurt growth in coming months by crimping consumer spending or pressuring corporate earnings.

The market is trying to gauge at what levels will yields or rates start to have negative consequences for stocks, ""whether that is a valuation re-rating or economic damage or earnings drag,"" said Matthew Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.

So far, however, stocks have been ""amazingly resilient"" to the rise in yields, he added.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/analysisrising-bond-yields-emerge-as-pressure-point-for-us-stock-rally-3149076,0.085,0.844,0.071,-0.8999

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes finished flat on Thursday, giving up most early gains on milder-than-feared inflation data as investors worried about the U.S. economy's longer-term prospects and whether stocks had further room to run.

Data showed headline and core consumer prices both climbed by 0.2% in July, with the headline number notching annual rise of 3.2% and the core up 4.7%.

In the first hour of trading, the three benchmark indexes advanced more than 1% as traders bet the U.S. Federal Reserve would stop further monetary tightening in 2023 and start cutting interest rates early next year.

Stock prices started to sag from late-morning onwards, and bounced between positive and negative territory for much of the afternoon.

""People looked at the headline number first and we had the big upswing, but as the day went on, the rally faded and that was probably the right reaction,"" said Gregg Abella, CEO of Investment Partners Asset Management.

He noted that while inflation has slowed, a look beyond the headline number revealed that core inflation remained sticky, and as traders parsed the data, the initial positive sentiment became more subdued.

San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly voiced that cautious tone, saying that while recent inflation data was moving in the right direction, more progress was needed before she would feel comfortable the central bank had done enough.

Thursday's modest gains were only the second positive August day for the and , as investors have used any gains as an opportunity to take profits after five months of advances on both indexes driven by strong growth in big technology stocks.

""A lot of tech valuations are predicated on rates falling, but there is nothing in the numbers, in my mind, to say that we're cutting rates - in fact, we may even see another quarter-point increase before the end of the year,"" said Abella, noting some big tech valuations were already lofty.

Further rises in these megacaps have also been limited by upward movement on 10-year U.S. Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark note went back above 4% on Thursday after a weak auction of 30-year paper.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) Corp dropped 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively, while Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc was flat and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) closed at a modest gain.

The rose 52.79 points, or 0.15%, to 35,176.15, the S&P 500 gained 1.12 points, or 0.03%, to 4,468.83 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.97 points, or 0.12%, to 13,737.99.

The major S&P sectors were split evenly between those, such as industrials and real estate, in negative territory, and climbers including communication services.

Energy, among this year's worst performing sectors, posted its sixth straight advance, one shy of the year-best seven consecutive gains it notched between March 23 and April 3.

On the earnings front, Walt Disney (NYSE: ) rose 4.9% after beating Wall Street estimates for quarterly adjusted profit per share.

Capri surged 55.7% after larger rival Tapestry (NYSE: ) said it would buy the Michael Kors parent in an $8.5 billion deal. Tapestry's shares fell 15.9%.

U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba (NYSE: ) climbed 4.6% after the e-commerce conglomerate reported upbeat quarterly sales on the back of improved consumer sentiment.

Heightening trade worries, President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order that prohibits some new U.S. investment in China in sensitive technologies such as computer chips and requires government notification for investment in other tech sectors.

(Reuters) - The California Institute of Technology has reached a ""potential settlement"" in a high-stakes patent infringement lawsuit against Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) over Wi-Fi chips, according to a Thursday filing in federal court.

Caltech previously won a verdict of more than $1.1 billion from Apple and Broadcom in the case that was later overturned.

The potential settlement was disclosed in a court document filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles without further details following a telephone conference. It was unclear if the agreement involved both Apple and Broadcom.

Representatives for Caltech, Apple and Broadcom did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court ordered the parties to file a joint status report by Aug. 18.

Pasadena, California-based Caltech sued Apple and Broadcom in 2016, alleging that millions of iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and other Apple devices using Broadcom chips infringed its wireless-communication patents. A jury ordered Apple to pay $837.8 million and Broadcom to pay $270.2 million in patent-infringement damages in 2020.

A U.S. appeals court overturned the award last year and ordered a new trial on damages, finding the amount was ""legally unsupportable."" A trial that had been scheduled to begin in June 2023 was postponed indefinitely in May.

Caltech told a Texas federal court on Tuesday that it had settled a related lawsuit against Samsung (KS: ). The university has also sued Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Dell and HP (NYSE: ) over its Wi-Fi patents in cases that are pending.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/caltech-reaches-potential-settlement-in-apple-broadcom-patent-case-3152049,0.061,0.885,0.055,0.0516

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Stock investors have been satisfied by middling U.S. corporate results so far this year but they might not be so easy to please for the rest of 2023.

As the second-quarter earnings season winds down, results are presenting a mixed picture, with companies beating analysts' profit expectations at the highest rate in nearly two years even as revenue beats dropped to the lowest since early 2020.

Investors appear content with that, for now. The S&P 500 has edged higher since earnings season began in July, with the benchmark index up 16% in 2023. But expectations call for corporate profits to pick up as the U.S. economy has so far defied recession fears, and investors may be far less forgiving if companies fail to deliver later this year, given the jump in equity valuations.

""Markets are expecting earnings to ... deliver above and beyond where they have been,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Asset Management. ""This is a market that has moved up in anticipation of earnings that we have not quite gotten yet.""

Overall, second-quarter earnings are expected to have fallen 3.8% from a year earlier, Refinitiv IBES data showed. That decline follows a 0.1% rise in the first quarter and a 3.2% drop in the fourth quarter of last year.

Results are expected to improve, however. Third-quarter S&P 500 earnings are seen rising 1.3% on a year-over-year basis, according to Refinitiv, before a 9.7% fourth-quarter earnings rise and a 11.9% full-year increase in 2024.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has become more richly valued. The index was trading at 19.1 times forward 12-month earnings estimates as of Thursday, compared to its long-term average of 15.6 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream. The P/E ratio ended 2022 at just below 17 times.

This year's valuation expansion accounted for 86% of the S&P 500's year-to-date return through July, with the rest of the market's boost coming from positive changes to earnings estimates, an analysis by Credit Suisse equity strategists showed.

""At this point, valuations have run ahead of the fundamentals and so companies now have to prove that they can generate earnings growth,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE: ).

Q2 RESULTS

With 91% of S&P 500 companies having reported second-quarter results, 78.7% posted earnings above analysts' expectations, according to Refinitiv IBES. In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings 7.7% above expectations, up from a long-term average of 4.1% above estimates. Both the beat rate and surprise factor are coming in at their highest rates since the third quarter of 2021.

However, for revenue, only 62.9% of companies have topped expectations - the lowest beat rate since the first quarter of 2020.

Stock reaction to earnings results has also been tepid, with share prices posting weaker responses to both beats and misses than the average over the past five years, analyst Julian Emanuel of Evercore ISI said. The average stock fell 0.6% after results in the second quarter, Emanuel said in a note on Thursday.

""We went from a market that is saying, 'Earnings had to back it up' to 'Thankfully earnings didn't screw this up,'"" said John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica (NYSE: ) Wealth Management. ""That just gets us into a more expensive realm.""

Meanwhile, there have also been some high profile disappointments, with Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) dropping 4.8% after the iPhone maker's weak sales forecast. Other megacap companies, such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), have seen a positive investor response to their reports.

Companies reporting results next week include key retailers, such as Walmart (NYSE: ) and Home Depot (NYSE: ), while the release of monthly retail sales on Tuesday also could influence markets.

While investors generally have turned more positive about the economic outlook, some still are wary of a recession stemming from the delayed impact of higher interest rates, as indicators such as the Treasury yield curve are still flashing warning signs. Such a downturn could severely change the prospects for corporate earnings and potentially weigh on valuations. During recessions, earnings fall at a 24% annual rate on average, according to Ned Davis Research. ""There is optimism, but I still wonder going into next year, are we too optimistic, from a consensus standpoint,"" said Comerica's Lynch. ""Just because we didn't have a recession this year, that yield curve continues to point to one.""",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/sluggish-us-earnings-may-need-pickmeup-to-support-2023-stock-rally-3152869,0.066,0.823,0.111,0.9909

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) made a few interesting moves in the second quarter, according to the firm's 13F with the SEC after the close of trading Monday. The most interesting trade was adding new positions in three homebuilders.

Berkshire showed new stakes in homebuilders D. R. Horton (DHI), Lennar Corp. (NYSE: ), and NVR, Inc. (NYSE: ). The position in D.R. Horton Inc (NYSE: ) was by far the largest at 5,969,714 shares. The firm also owns 152,572 share of Lennar and 11,112 shares of NVR.

The position is interesting as homebuilders have been facing a wave of higher interest rates which has slowed the homebuilding frenzy. Perhaps the new stakes in a bet that interest rates will fall and the home buying frenzy will resume.

Wedbush analysts maintained an Outperform rating and a $230.00 price target for Apple (NASDAQ: ). They raised the possibility of Apple acquiring ESPN assets from Walt Disney (NYSE: ), citing the tech giant's increasing interest in securing live sports content for its Apple TV streaming platform.

They note that Apple's pursuit of live sports content has gained momentum, aligning with its strategy to boost subscriber numbers for Apple TV+. With over 50 million paid subscribers on the platform, the recent 10-year MLS streaming soccer deal when Lionel Messi signed with Inter Miami, significantly bolstered subscription numbers for the MLS Season Pass worldwide.

They suggest that ESPN's assets could be a strategic fit for Apple, potentially aligning with the company's evolving streaming ambitions.

Despite Apple's historical avoidance of significant M&A activity, the analysts believe the shifting streaming landscape could prompt a change in approach. Acquiring ESPN, with an estimated price tag of over $50 billion, would provide Apple with valuable sports content, extensive TV rights covering major professional and college sports packages, and an enhanced cross-sell potential for Apple TV.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apples-acquisition-of-espn-would-be-a-no-brainer--wedbush-432SI-3155930,0.01,0.882,0.108,0.9549

ARENDAL, Norway (Reuters) - Norway's $1.4 trillion wealth fund, the world's single largest stock market investor, is to step up pressure on the companies it invests in to have more women board members and to also reduce excessive executive pay, a top fund official said.

The fund is one of a growing number investors and policymakers pushing to put more women in company boardrooms. Having a broader range of experiences around a boardroom table has been shown to improve decision-making and corporate culture.

The fund holds stakes in around 9,200 companies globally, equivalent to 1.5% of all listed stocks and has set the pace on many issues in the field of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG).

Its latest move comes as the fund takes stock of its ESG engagement with companies so far this year. On Wednesday, it published for the first time an analysis of its voting record during this year's annual shareholder meeting season, where investors vote on issues including executive pay.

Since 2021, the fund has campaigned to boost the number of women on company boards and to consider targets if fewer than 30% of directors are female.

""This year we said (to companies) that 'if you don't have even one woman on the board, we will vote against you'. We will step that up next year,"" Carine Smith Ihenacho, the fund's chief governance and compliance officer, told Reuters in an interview.

She said specific details of how the fund will do this have not been decided. One option could be to expand the fund's focus to more countries - at the moment the fund concentrates on the United States, Europe and Japan.

""So far, we haven't looked at developing markets,"" said Smith Ihenacho. ""We can (also) step it up in Japan, increase the (minimum) threshold from one to two (women on a board).""

The fund has also put executive pay in the spotlight and now plans to also step up the pressure, though details of how are not decided.

""We are concerned. The large packages are getting larger, and from the figures we have seen, the larger packages are increasing more than the median of packages, and more than inflation,"" said Smith Ihenacho.

So far this year, the fund voted against 1 in every 10 CEO pay packages, more than in recent years, and including against a growing number in the United States, its report showed.

This year for the first time the fund analysed the structure of all U.S. pay packages above $20 million to see if they aligned with long-term value creation.

As a result of its analysis, the fund voted against more than half of pay packages above this level, the report showed.

By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple on Monday won the dismissal of a lawsuit claiming that the blood oxygen sensor on its Apple Watch exhibits ""racial bias"" against people with darker skin tones.

U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan dismissed the proposed class action with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again. He plans to explain his reasons by Aug. 31.

The plaintiff Alex Morales, a resident of Manhattan's Upper East Side, said he paid an inflated price for his Apple Watch based on his mistaken belief that its blood oxygen app would measure blood oxygen levels ""without regard to skin tone.""

His amended complaint, filed in May, cited decades of reports that similar pulse oximetry devices were ""significantly less accurate"" when measuring blood oxygen levels of nonwhite people.

Morales said the real-world impact of this bias was not addressed until the COVID-19 pandemic led to ""greater awareness of structural racism"" in society.

Apple said Morales failed to make any allegations supporting his fraud claim, or show that it exposed him to anything misleading before his purchase.

Morales' lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Doctors have long known that pulse oximeters, which help assess potential heart and respiratory problems, are less accurate in estimating blood oxygen of non-white patients.

The pandemic exposed some of the devices' shortcomings, with some patients facing treatment delays or being discharged from emergency rooms too soon.

Investing.com -- Shares of Japanese technology conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp (TYO: ) rose on Tuesday after its unit, chip designer Arm, filed for a long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq.

Arm said on late-Monday that it had publicly filed a registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list its shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, although the firm did not specify how many shares will be issued and at what valuation.

The move comes after several delays in SoftBank’s plans to list the firm, following the implosion of the $40 billion Arm sale to Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), over antitrust concerns.

SoftBank (OTC: ) had repeatedly delayed the listing, and had only recently provided a timeline on the matter, as the Japanese tech giant seeks to capitalize on a boom in artificial intelligence development in the coming years.

Arm is expected to benefit from this boom, given that its designs are used in chips by several major tech giants including Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia. The firm receives royalties from every chip sold by its customers.

SoftBank’s shares rose as much as 3%, also helping spur a 0.7% gain in the . Arm’s listing heralds a shot in the arm for the tech giant, which has been otherwise struggling with a sharp drop in the valuations of its tech holdings over the past year.

SoftBank clocked six straight quarters of losses as rising interest rates battered the value of its tech holdings. Arm had remained among the few bright spots in SoftBank’s portfolio, although the chip designer also swung to a loss in the second quarter.

Arm’s listing comes at a time when several major chipmakers have warned of a cyclical downturn for the industry, with chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: ) recently warning that a boom in AI demand may be insufficient to offset a broader decline.

Still, the firm’s listing is expected to provide SoftBank with more capital. Recent Reuters reports said that SoftBank plans to sell about 10% of Arm’s shares in the planned IPO, and that it is seeking a valuation of between $60 billion and $70B for the unit.

SoftBank also recently bought back a 25% stake in Arm from its Saudi-backed Vision Fund.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/softbank-rises-as-chip-unit-arm-files-for-nasdaq-ipo-3158656,0.042,0.868,0.09,0.9545

Investing.com -- Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) edged higher in premarket trading on Wednesday, as investors eagerly awaited the release of the chipmaker's latest quarterly results.

California-based Nvidia, which manufactures the graphics processors that power generative artificial intelligence, has become a focal point in a surge in excitement over the nascent technology.

Nvidia's share price has tripled this year, thanks in large part to a stellar forecast in May that propelled the stock's market value to above $1 trillion, on par with tech industry behemoths like Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

The announcement initiated a fresh wave of hype around AI's potentially game-changing applications, a euphoria that in turn pushed up other Big Tech players and drove a broader stock market rally. The so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap companies, which include Nvidia, have helped spur on a more than 14% jump in the benchmark this year.

Analysts have said that Nvidia's numbers and the outlook for the rest of the year could thus influence the near-term course of not only the AI boom but broader market sentiment.

According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, Nvidia is projected to have posted revenue of $11.04 billion in its second quarter. Nearly three-fourths of the top-line figure is expected to consist of revenue from Nvidia's crucial data center business, which houses its all-important H100 chip used in AI-fueled platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

In a recent note to clients, analysts at Piper Sandler said they believe the conversation around Nvidia will ""boil down to the data center"" unit. They added that they are confident the division will see ""continued growth,"" so much so they anticipate that data center revenues will reach $50B by Nvidia's 2025 fiscal year.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-shares-inch-up-premarket-ahead-of-highly-anticipated-earnings-release-3159913,0.003,0.899,0.098,0.9729

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended sharply higher on Wednesday as shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) gained ahead of quarterly results from the company whose chips are widely used for artificial intelligence (AI) computing.

Shares of Nvidia, which reported results after the closing bell, jumped 9%, extending a gain of 3.2% during the regular session.

It forecast third-quarter revenue above Wall Street targets. Other tech companies jumped in after-hours trading as well including Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), which was last up about 2%.

Bullish investors have been hopeful that upbeat news from Nvidia could could further ear's strong rally in tech stocks. Including the session move, Nvidia's stock is up more than 220% for the year so far.

""Not just their numbers, but what they say in the conference call about what's happening in AI is going to have a big impact on market sentiment,"" said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.

Nvidia is part of the so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap stocks including Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) that have powered the 's sharp gains this year.

During the trading session, stock investors were encouraged as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note eased from near 16-year highs after weak business activity data from the United States and the euro zone.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments on Friday at the Jackson Hole conference will be scrutinized for clues on the U.S. central bank's interest rate path.

The rose 184.15 points, or 0.54%, to 34,472.98, the S&P 500 gained 48.46 points, or 1.10%, to 4,436.01 and the added 215.16 points, or 1.59%, to 13,721.03.

Data showed U.S. business activity approached the stagnation point in August, with growth at its weakest since February, as demand for new business in the vast service sector contracted, while the downturn in euro zone activity was far deeper than expected.

Before the PMI data, yields on the 10-year note had been rising this month as investors were thinking the Fed could keep rates higher for longer.

According to strategists in a Reuters poll, the S&P 500 will eke out only marginal gains between now and year end, after its strong move up already this year. The index was forecast to end the year at 4,496.

Shares of drugmaker Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: ) rose 0.9% and Merck & Co advanced 3.8% after Swiss rival Roche inadvertently published positive lung cancer drug trial data.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. trade chief Katherine Tai has raised concerns with India over the Asian nation's new order mandating licenses for the import of laptops, tablets and personal computers, according to a statement.

Tai's intervention comes amid worries the licensing regime could impact shipments from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Dell and force firms to boost local manufacturing.

""She noted that there were stakeholders that needed an opportunity to review and provide input to ensure that the policy, if implemented, does not have an adverse impact on U.S. exports to India,"" as per the U.S. statement issued after Tai met with India's Trade Minister Piyush Goyal on August 26.

Tai was in India to join the G20 trade ministers' meeting last week in the western state of Rajasthan.

India's new licensing regime, which is due to come into effect on November 1, aims to ""ensure trusted hardware and systems"" enter the nation. It also seeks to reduce dependence on imports, boost local manufacturing, and in part address the country's trade imbalance with China, according to an Indian government official.

India and the U.S. will also continue discussions to find a solution to the only bilateral dispute between the two nations at the World Trade Organisation, which involves measures by New Delhi on certain agricultural imports into the country, according to the statement.

Investing.com -- China slashes a levy on stock trading in a bid to reinvigorate capital markets and boost investor confidence. Shares in the country rise following the announcement, although ailing property group Evergrande's shares slide sharply after they start trading for the first time since March 2022. Meanwhile, 3M's stock climbs in premarket trading on reports that the industrial conglomerate has reached a settlement over personal injury claims related to earplugs it has sold to the U.S. military.

1. Chinese shares jump following trading levy cut

Shares in China rose on Monday after regulators slashed the country's 0.1% stamp duty on stock trading in half, as Beijing attempts to restore investor confidence and reignite its flagging capital markets.

China’s and indexes both surged about 2.4% at one point, while Hong Kong’s added 1.8%. The three were the best performers in Asia, recovering from their weakest levels this year, although analysts warned that the rally may be short-lived as the impact from the cuts wanes.

Property stocks were among the top performers. The sole exception was China Evergrande Group (HK: ), which resumed trading in Hong Kong for the first time in almost a year and a half on Monday. Shares in the embattled developer at the center of China's real estate crisis plummeted by about 80%, shedding as much as $2 billion in value.

2. Futures point higher

U.S. stock futures edged higher on Monday, with investors digesting comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on the potential path ahead for the U.S. central bank's monetary policy.

At 05:16 ET (09:16 GMT), the contract added 68 points or 0.20%, inched up by 6 points or 0.14%, and increased by 33 points or 0.22%. The main indices all closed in the green to end the prior trading week.

In a highly anticipated speech at an annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming on Friday, Powell argued to keep steady for now. But he noted that ""further tightening"" could be warranted if the economy does not slow enough to help cool . The statements highlighted how carefully Powell is trying to adjust the levers of monetary policy to corral price gains without causing a meltdown in the wider economy.

There is an 80% chance that the Fed will maintain borrowing costs at a range of 5.25% to 5.50% at its next meeting in September, according to Investing.com's . Meanwhile, the probability of a quarter-point hike at its November gathering stands at just under 50%.

3. Oil ticks up amid China economic support measures

Oil prices moved up on Monday, with traders attempting to gauge the effect of China's trading stamp duty decrease on the world's largest crude importer.

The move was seen as the latest in a series of incremental steps taken by Beijing to help reinvigorate the country's sputtering post-pandemic recovery. However, doubts remain over whether China's government is still doing enough to provide badly needed support to possibly one of the major drivers of oil demand this year.

Investors will have an opportunity to examine the state of the economy later this week when China's crucial for August is released. Economists expect the reading to remain in contraction territory.

At 05:17 ET, rose by 0.1% to $84.06 a barrel, while U.S. crude gained 0.3% to $80.09 per barrel. Both slid to their second-straight weekly losses on Friday after Powell noted that more rate increases may be needed to help quell inflation in the U.S., exacerbating worries over demand in the top oil consumer.

4. 3M nearing $5.5B earplugs settlement - reports

3M Co. (NYSE: ) is reportedly nearing an agreement to pay $5.5B to resolve hundreds of thousands of claims brought against the company alleging that its earplugs sold to the U.S. military were defective.

According to multiple media reports, sources close to the matter say that the negotiations are ongoing and a final amount has yet to be finalized. The potential settlement was first reported by Bloomberg.

Shares in 3M popped in premarket U.S. trading.

More than 300,000 current and former service members have filed claims blaming Minnesota-based 3M and one of its subsidiaries for knowingly making earplugs that failed to protect them from hearing loss. 3M has contested the allegations, saying the earplugs work correctly when users are given proper training.

The $5.5B settlement amount would be far less than the $10B to $15B figure estimated by some analysts. However, it could still add to 3M's litigation costs, which are likely to mount further following a tentative multi-billion dollar settlement earlier this year to lawsuits over so-called ""forever chemicals"" in municipal water supplies.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) is reportedly revamping its iPad Pro to help lift customer flagging sales of the tech giant's high-end tablet, according to Bloomberg News.

The next iPad Pro models will feature new iterations of Apple's M3 silicon chips, which are designed to be faster and more efficient than their predecessors, Bloomberg said. OLED displays -- a long-time staple of Apple's iPhone handset -- will also be used in the fresh iPad versions, which will also come in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that Apple's Magic Keyboard accessory will also be overhauled to make the user's experience with the tablet more like that of a laptop.

The new iPad models will not feature in Apple's annual launch event next month, Bloomberg noted, and will likely not be available for purchase until spring or early summer of 2024.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/china-cuts-trading-tax-3ms-reported-earplugs-settlement--whats-moving-markets-3162366,0.061,0.848,0.092,0.981

(Reuters) -Apple said on Tuesday it would host its fall event on Sept. 12, setting the stage for what analysts believe will be the unveiling of a new line of iPhones and smartwatches.

The event will be hosted at the Steve Jobs Theater at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, according to invites from the world's most valuable company.

Wall Street analysts have said Apple (NASDAQ: ) will try to entice shoppers with a range of new features for its flagship device, as the launch comes against the backdrop of a slump in smartphone demand globally.

Apple posted a 2.4% decline in iPhone sales for its fiscal third quarter - a rare drop for the product that has for years powered the company's growth.

The most expensive variant of the new generation iPhone will have a periscope camera that could improve zoom capacity by 5 times or more, according TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

The expected watch lineup may feature a new processor based on Apple's A15 Bionic chip, already used in previous iPhone models, and will boost performance, according to a Bloomberg News report.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-to-host-fall-event-on-sept-12-3163507,0.016,0.917,0.067,0.8908

AAPL +0.68% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Apple (NASDAQ: ) has announced that its much-anticipated special event will take place on September 12.

The “Wonderlust” event will take place at the Steve Jobs Theater inside Apple Park, the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California.

Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro. Reports suggest that these new iPhone models will come with substantial enhancements including new color options, improved battery performance, a transition from Apple's proprietary lightning connector to USB-C, faster charging, and significantly upgraded camera capabilities, according to tech blog 9to5Mac.

BofA analysts believe the focus will be on the new iPhone pricing, as well as the timing and cadence of the launch.

“We model 216mn iPhones for F23 (down 11% y/y), and then 10% y/y unit growth in F24 which is somewhat dependent on how Apple prices the new phones and subsidies offered by carriers,” the analysts said in a client note.

“If iPhone 15 (at least some models) starts shipping on Sep 22nd, that would imply 9 ship days in F4Q23 for the new phones, similar to last year’s F4Q22. The broad availability of the iPhone 15 Pro Max could be October given some manufacturing challenges,” they added.

Citi analysts are more bullish as they recently placed Apple stock on Citi’s Upside Catalyst Watch list. They believe Apple will increase the prices for iPhone 15 Pro models by $100-$200.

“iPhone 15 is expected to be a strong replacement cycle in iPhone 12 installed base with additional excitement around ~30% faster charging on upgraded USB-C. Unit expectation for iPhone 15 remains around 80-85M (Citi 81M) subject to image sensor manufacturing supply,” the analysts wrote in a report.

“We continue to recommend our positive AAPL catalyst watch going into the event.”

(Reuters) -Five Chinese tech firms, including Baidu Inc (NASDAQ: ) and SenseTime Group, on Thursday launched their artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots to the public after receiving government approval, as China's government pushes to widen the use of such products amid competition with the United States.

Baidu, China's leading online search provider, said in a statement that its ChatGPT-like chatbot, Ernie Bot, was now fully accessible to the public. A SenseTime spokesperson told Reuters via email that its chatbot, SenseChat, was also now ""fully available to serve all users"".

Three AI start-ups, Baichuan Intelligent Technology, Zhipu AI and MiniMax, also announced similar public launches on Thursday.

Shares in Baidu and SenseTime jumped in Hong Kong trade, gaining 2.1% and 2.3% respectively in a broader market that was trading 0.55% lower.

Unlike other countries, China requires companies to submit security assessments and receive clearance before releasing mass-market AI products.

Authorities have recently accelerated efforts to support companies developing AI as the technology increasingly becomes a focus of competition with the United States.

Chinese media reported that a total of 11 firms had received approvals from the government, including TikTok owner ByteDance and Tencent Holdings (OTC: ). Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment about their AI plans.

Baidu's CEO Robin Li said on Thursday that by making Ernie Bot widely available, Baidu would ""collect massive amount of valuable real-world human feedback"" to further improve the chatbot.

Baidu also plans on releasing a series of ""AI-native apps"", the company said.

EARLY MOVER ADVANTAGE

It is unclear whether Alibaba (NYSE: ) has received approval as of this week. But an Alibaba Cloud spokesperson told Reuters that the company had completed filings for its AI model, Tongyi Qianwen, and that the model was awaiting its official launch.

The person also said the company expected the regulators to release a list of companies with approvals within the coming week.

Being the first to market in China is considered critical for the country's cut-throat internet industry. Baidu's Ernie Bot topped the free app category on Apple (NASDAQ: )'s App Store in China on Thursday after the announcement.

""I think the ones that got approved have an early mover advantage to be able to fine-tune their product faster than competitors,"" Kai Wang, an analyst at Morningstar.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), is on track to generate more than $1 billion in revenue over the next 12 months, tech-focused publication The Information reported on Tuesday.

The approvals were widely anticipated after China published a set of interim rules aimed at regulating generative AI products for the public that went into effect on Aug. 15.

Previously, companies were only allowed to conduct small-scale public tests of AI products but with the new rules, companies have widened their AI product tests by enabling more features and engaging in more marketing. Prior government approval is not needed for products targeting businesses.

Shawn Yang, an analyst at Blue Lotus Capital Advisors, said the government's move to greenlight AI products could spark consolidation in the industry.

""Many people were rushing into the large language model business,"" he said, ""But the industry may soon consolidate. Only those with data and tech capability will be able to push forward.""",https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/china-lets-baidu-others-launch-chatgptlike-bots-to-public-tech-shares-jump-3164928,0.01,0.908,0.082,0.9888

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Customers of Arm Holdings Ltd including Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) Corp, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) Inc have agreed to invest in the chip designer's initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter.

Intel Corp (NASDAQ: ), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ), Cadence Design (NASDAQ: ) Systems Inc and Synopsys (NASDAQ: ) Inc have also agreed to participate as investors in the offering, the sources added. The talks are ongoing and some other potential investors are also in discussions to invest in the IPO, the sources added.

SoftBank (TYO: ) Group Corp, which owns Britain-based Arm, is targeting a valuation between $50 billion and $55 billion, Reuters reported earlier on Friday. Arm's clients have agreed to invest in that valuation range, the sources said.

While it is possible that demand for Arm's shares will lead to a higher valuation by the time the IPO prices, the move represents a climb-down from the $64 billion valuation at which SoftBank acquired the 25% stake in the company it did not already own from its $100 billion Vision Fund last month.

Apple, Nvidia and the other strategic investors have agreed to invest between $25 million and $100 million each in the blockbuster IPO, the sources said. Arm and SoftBank have set aside 10% of the shares to be sold in the IPO for its clients, Reuters has previously reported.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ), which had previously held talks to invest in the IPO, has decided not to participate, one of the sources said, requesting anonymity as the discussions are confidential.

A scramble among Arm's clients, comprising the world's biggest technology companies, to snap up shares in the IPO is testing the semiconductor designer's adherence to not picking sides in the chip industry.

The interest is fueled by a desire by companies to expand their commercial relationship with Arm and make sure rivals do not gain an edge, Reuters has previously reported.

While an investment in the IPO would not come with a seat on Arm's board or ability to dictate strategy, it could strengthen ties with each participating company and make it harder for a competitor to acquire Arm later.

Arm and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

AMD, Intel, Synopsys and Nvidia declined to comment. Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Samsung and Cadence did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Arm Holdings Ltd, the chip designer owned by SoftBank (TYO: ) Group Corp, is planning to ask investors to pay $47 to $51 for each of its shares when it begins marketing its initial public offering (IPO) next week, people familiar with the matter said on Saturday.

The price range, which has not been previously reported, would translate into a valuation for Arm of roughly between $50 billion and $54 billion, and an offering of $5 billion to $5.4 billion. It would make Arm the most valuable company to list in New York since electric car maker Rivian (NASDAQ: ) Automotive debuted in 2021.

SoftBank could possibly raise this range before the IPO prices, should investor demand prove strong, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the matter is confidential.

Arm declined to comment while SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The valuation Arm is currently seeking represents a climb-down from the $64 billion valuation at which SoftBank acquired the 25% stake in the company it did not already own from its $100 billion Vision Fund last month.

This reflects a recent drop in demand for some of Arm's offerings. For the year ended March 31, Arm's sales fell to $2.68 billion, hurt mainly by a slump in global smartphone shipments.

Arm has already signed up many of its major clients as investors in its IPO, Reuters reported on Friday. These include Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) Corp, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) Inc, Intel Corp (NASDAQ: ), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ), Cadence Design (NASDAQ: ) Systems Inc and Synopsys (NASDAQ: ) Inc.

The companies' interest is fueled by a desire to expand their commercial relationship with Arm and make sure rivals do not gain an edge, Reuters has previously reported.

This is because the customers view Arm's semiconductor designs as an indispensable resource. They are used by more than 260 technology companies to make over 30 billion chips annually, powering 99% of the world’s smartphones and everything from the tiniest of sensors to the most powerful supercomputers.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusivesoftbanks-arm-to-ask-for-47-to-51-per-share-in-ipo-source-3166540,0.027,0.912,0.061,0.9301

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Mobile app stores in China run by Tencent Holdings (OTC: ), Xiaomi (OTC: ) and others have started to bar app publishers from launching new apps if they do not make all the disclosures required by authorities, documents seen by Reuters showed.

The moves comply with new rules introduced last month as Beijing tightens oversight of mobile apps in the country. The rules are causing consternation in the industry that publishing apps in the world's second largest economy will become very difficult and many apps may need to be taken down.

The new rules, which require mobile app publishers to file business details with the government, gave app stores in China until the end of August to establish their filing systems to oversee new apps.

""The Android app stores have confirmed that new apps require the app filings from Friday onwards, and existing apps must have it from March 31 onwards,"" Rich Bishop, CEO of app publishing firm AppInChina said.

""It forces all global apps on these app stores to either establish a local entity or work with a local partner.""

The new rules show that while authorities appear to have ended a years-long, wide-ranging regulatory crackdown on China's technology sector, it still faces scrutiny as Beijing aims to keep business activities pegged to its socialist ideals.

Last week, Android-based app stores operated by Tencent, Huawei Technologies, Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo issued notices to app publishers and said they will bar new apps without sufficient paperwork from being featured on their platforms. Some of the notices were seen by Reuters while others featured in blog posts by Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) has not disclosed how its app store in China will comply with Beijing's new rules. As of Monday, it is not yet checking apps' filing status, AppInChina said, citing its own checks.

Apple did not reply to Reuters' request for comment. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Tencent, Huawei, Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo also did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Tencent's WeChat, China's most popular social media platform, also notified app publishers that the same filing requirement is being applied to the so-called ""WeChat Mini Apps"", which refer to apps that are published on WeChat directly.

According to Huawei's notice, MIIT has established a dedicated task force to enforce the new policy. It has scheduled talks with industry participants about the new policy.

The notice also said app stores will have to clearly mark each app's filing status on their platforms.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tencent-others-begin-enforcing-chinas-new-oversight-move-on-apps-3166696,0.006,0.965,0.029,0.886

British chip designer, Arm Holdings, is preparing for a significant initial public offering (IPO), which is expected to be the largest of the year. The company has priced its IPO in a range that would value it at up to $52 billion, according to a filing on Tuesday. This valuation is below a $64 billion calculation following a recent stake sale involving its current owner SoftBank (TSE:TYO: ).

SoftBank plans to sell about 10% of total shares outstanding in the offering. The IPO will test market appetite for an important technology company in an environment of high interest rates. Despite the lower-than-expected valuation, Arm remains optimistic, as it aims to issue 95.5 million American depositary shares priced between $47 and $51 each.

Arm's technology powers chips inside nearly every smartphone globally. It hopes that several of its partners, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), will invest in its IPO as strategic investors. Such investments could potentially push up the valuation.

However, Arm's exposure to the sluggish smartphone market and the Chinese market have raised questions among analysts about its growth trajectory. Albie Amankona, an analyst at Third Bridge, expressed skepticism about the long-term sustainability of revenue growth and high margins of ARM in a research note on Monday. He predicts a yearly revenue growth of 5-10% for the next five years, followed by a peak and subsequent contraction on a yearly basis.

In its most recent fiscal year, Arm generated $2.68 billion of revenue and net income of $524 million. The company's targeted valuation suggests a trailing price-to-earnings multiple of 92 to 100 times, less than Nvidia's 117 times but significantly higher than other chip makers like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), which trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 15 times.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's three major averages closed lower on Wednesday with the Nasdaq's 1% loss leading declines after stronger-than-expected services sector data fueled concerns that still sticky inflation would mean that interest rates stay higher for longer.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Wednesday its non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 54.5 last month against expectations of 52.5, while a gauge of prices paid by service-sector businesses for inputs increased.

Traders were betting on a 93% chance that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchanged after its meeting on Sept. 20, while bets on another pause in November were around 57%, CME Group's (NASDAQ: ) FedWatch Tool showed.

""The stronger-than-expected ISM services data shows that investors are still not very skilled at reading the post-pandemic tea leaves,"" said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO's family office in Minneapolis.

While market participants have been hoping for interest rate cuts soon, Schleif said the data shows a strong economy and inflation that is not coming down ""as fast as the Fed would need to start cutting rates any time in the foreseeable future.""

Earlier in the day Boston Fed President Susan Collins stressed the need for the central bank to ""proceed carefully"" with its next monetary policy steps.

The prospect of higher rates put particular pressure on growth stocks with the growth index underperforming the benchmark throughout the session. Equity investors were also reacting to rising yields in 10-year and the two-year U.S. Treasuries.

""Growth stocks have been pricing in the idea that inflation has been well anchored and that the Fed's going to cut. If that idea no longer holds they're going to be vulnerable,"" said Patrick Kaser, portfolio manager from Brandywine Global.

On top of rate concerns, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), which finished down 3.6%, was pressured by a report that China had banned officials at central government agencies from using iPhones and other foreign-branded devices for work.

The fell 198.78 points, or 0.57%, to 34,443.19, the S&P 500 lost 31.35 points, or 0.70%, at 4,465.48 and the dropped 148.48 points, or 1.06%, to 13,872.47.

Of the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors, growth-heavy technology was the biggest decliner, losing 1.4%, while defensive utilities led gains, up 0.2%. Energy was the only other gainer, up 0.1% with support from higher oil prices.

Oil futures settled up on Wednesday, adding to recent gains, which fueled concerns about inflationary pressure.

The S&P 500 showed little reaction to the Fed's ""Beige Book"" snapshot of the U.S. economy a week ahead of the keenly awaited August inflation data and the Fed's rate decision on Sept. 20.

The report showed ""modest"" U.S. economic growth in recent weeks while job growth was ""subdued,"" and inflation slowed in most parts of the country.

Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) shares sank 4.8% after the U.S. weapons maker trimmed the delivery outlook for its F-35 jets.

Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: ) saw an unexpected rise of 3.2% on Thursday, despite a broad sell-off in most semiconductor stocks due to escalating U.S.-China tensions. This follows reports from Wednesday that China may ban government agencies from using iPhones, triggering a sell-off not only in Apple (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ) but also among its suppliers and other semiconductor equipment stocks.

While some analysts have termed these worries as ""overblown"", Intel has historically seen gains during such periods of U.S.-China tension. Despite having China exposure through its PC and data center processors, Intel is building out a U.S.-based foundry ecosystem it hopes will rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). There is speculation that Intel could significantly benefit if chip designers pivot to Intel's foundries in the event of a destabilizing situation in Taiwan.

In addition to this, Intel received positive analyst commentary on the very day regarding its emerging foundry ecosystem. At an industry conference at the end of August, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced that the company had received a large pre-payment for its foundry ecosystem. Specifically, the pre-payment was for 18A, the leading-edge 1.8nm fab Intel plans on bringing online at the end of 2024. This fab is expected to produce chips that will regain process-node parity with, or even leadership over, TSMC.

Citi analyst Christopher Danely noted on Thursday that the pre-payment likely came from a ""whale"", referring to an extremely large chipmaker that is likely a leader in its market. This could be seen as a promising vote of confidence in Intel's fledgling foundry and could play a key role in its turnaround.

Leading chip designers such as Apple and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ) would probably like an alternative foundry partner to manufacture their chips other than TSMC, which has increased prices over the past few years due to its leadership position. Moreover, Intel could especially benefit if customers become nervous about U.S.-China relations, which could potentially lead to an attempted invasion of Taiwan.

Gelsinger also noted that Intel's current quarter was tracking above the mid-point of guidance, indicating a potential bottom in the PC market. Intel's roadmap to catch up to TSMC appears on track, and there is growing interest in Intel's Max and Gaudi AI accelerators, which have the potential to carve out some share of the booming AI market.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A new series of smartphones launched by China's Huawei Technologies has drawn global attention for containing technology that indicates the company has managed to overcome U.S. sanctions and could come back as a rival to Apple (NASDAQ: )

In late August, the company unveiled the Mate 60 and Mate 60 Pro, and on Friday launched two more smartphones, the Mate X5 which is a new version of its foldable phones, and the Mate 60 Pro+. The Mate 60 is priced from 5,999 yuan ($817.70), the same as Apple's iPhone 14 in China.

Here are some key things to know about Huawei's new phones, their suppliers, and what they could mean for the world's largest smartphone market:

WHAT IS THE MATE 60 SERIES CAPABLE OF?

Huawei has mainly advertised the smartphones' ability to support satellite communications which allow users to place calls or send messages even in areas where there are no mobile signals or internet, such as on mountains or at sea.

It has not disclosed details of the chips used, but analysis firm TechInsights has found that the phone is powered by a new Kirin 9000s chip that was made in China by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).

Speed tests shared by buyers on Chinese social media have suggested that the Mate 60 Pro is capable of download speeds exceeding those of top line 5G phones.

Chinese buyers comparing the phones to Apple's latest iPhone 14 have posted reviews online saying they have comparable specifications like storage and memory. Huawei's launch also comes days before Apple is expected to launch its new iPhone 15 on Sept. 12.

WHO ARE THE MATE 60'S SUPPLIERS?

Huawei has not officially named the suppliers for the phones' components, though apart from SMIC, TechInsights also said it found South Korea's SK Hynix's DRAM and NAND components in the phone.

SK Hynix, which said it stopped doing business with Huawei since the United States introduced restrictions on the firm in 2019, has said it is investigating.

The Mate 60 Pro contains more Chinese-made chip components than previous models, TechInsights also said.

Lists of possible Chinese suppliers have been widely circulated online, with shares of companies touted as possible candidates soaring on the speculation.

Most of these are existing suppliers to Huawei. Shares in Dongguan Chitwing Technology Co. Ltd, which makes molds, for instance rose by the daily upward limit of 10% in the days after Huawei's launch. It did not respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

Suzhou-based display maker Visionox Technology, whose shares have risen by 15% since the new smartphones were launched on Aug. 29, told Reuters it was a supplier for the new Mate 60 series.

WHAT COULD IT MEAN FOR APPLE IN CHINA'S SMARTPHONE MARKET?

Huawei was once the world's largest smartphone firm by sales but saw its market share steadily slump after the United States cut its access to chip-making tools essential for producing the most advanced handset models. The company was left only able to sell limited batches of 5G models using stockpiled chips.

Its market share in China, the world's largest smartphone market, has fallen to 11% so far this year compared to 27% in 2020, in part also due to its move to sell its budget brand Honor in what it described then as a bid to ensure its survival.

The U.S. restrictions left Apple as the main maker of premium smartphones in China. Over the same period, Apple's market share in China rose to 19% from 11%，according to data from research firm Counterpoint.

Analysts say the Mate 60 might mark Huawei's comeback as a rival, with sales helped by patriotic fervor as state media and internet users cheer the launch as a blow against the United States amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing.

Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with TF International Securities, said he expects the Mate 60 Pro to ship between 5.5 to 6 million units for the second half of this year, up 20% from previously planned volumes.

And cumulative shipments of Mate 60 Pro could reach at least 12 million units 12 months after launch, according to Kuo.

SHANGHAI/TAIPEI (Reuters) -China's widening curbs on iPhone use by government staff intensified a sell-off in global tech stocks on Friday on fears Apple and its suppliers could take a hit from rising Sino-U.S. tensions and growing competition from Huawei.

Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) tumbled 6.4% in the previous two days, wiping $190 billion from its market capitalisation, following news Beijing ordered some central government employees in recent weeks to stop using iPhones at work.

Several Wall Street analysts on Friday said the selloff was overdone, claiming that any revenue hit for Apple would likely be small due to the phone's popularity in China. After two days of declines, Apple shares rebounded in Friday trading, up 1.3%.

Apple is facing stepped-up competition from China's Huawei, which launched two new smartphones - the foldable Mate X5 and the Mate 60 Pro+ - that drew global attention for showcasing resilience to U.S. sanctions.

Some analysts believe Huawei's moves could be a first step in comeback efforts by China's ""national champion"" to rival Apple after it took some market share following U.S. sanctions rolled out four years ago. Apple is set to roll out a new iPhone on Tuesday following a weak quarter for sales of its flagship product.

""We believe Huawei's activity this time was well prepared and not sudden,"" said Ivan Lam, an analyst at Counterpoint, whose outlook for the new products exceeds previous estimation. ""It can manage the psychological expectations of the target consumer group before Apple's press conference.""

China has been a bright spot for Apple, its third-largest market behind the Americas and Europe, in an otherwise tough period for iPhone sales. Huawei's smartphone business was decimated after the United States curbed tech exports to it in 2019.

Apple's sales in China this year have been helped by rare deals launched by its third-party retailers in February that offered discounts on its iPhone 14 Pro by as much as 10%. However, analysts told Reuters that those discounts could end up undermining sales of Apple's new products set to launch in the coming days.

In Taipei, Apple supplier Largan Precision, which makes camera lenses, dropped more than 4%, while contract chipmaker TSMC fell 0.6% on Friday. China's Luxshare Precision Industry, owner of factories capable of making iPhones, fell 2%.

Shares of U.S.-based Apple suppliers were little changed on Friday, with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) up 0.1% and Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) down 0.4%.

Huawei suppliers extended recent gains. Shares in Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), which is believed to have made the advanced chip in Huawei's new smartphone, rose 0.7%.

SCOPE OF CURBS UNCLEAR

It was not immediately clear how wide China's iPhone curbs are, but one employee at an affected state-owned enterprise (SOE) in the capital said they extended to visitors.

""Anyone, including business visitors, who enters our work area cannot bring in their iPhones,"" said the source, one of two SOE employees who said they were told of the ban in recent weeks.

The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the company was giving employees a subsidy of 100-200 yuan ($13-$26) to switch to local brands. Some staff at other SOEs, however, told Reuters they had not been banned from using iPhones.

While the number of central government employees is not public, Bank of America estimated that such a ban could cut iPhone sales by 5 million-10 million units a year from China's annual total of up to 50 million.

Huawei's smartphone sales driven by the new Mate 60 Pro could jump 65% this year to 38 million in the absence of some ""non-commercial risks,"" said Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities.

However, Canalys analyst Nicole Peng said Huawei could present a greater threat to domestic peers, and Morgan Stanley's Erik Woodring on Friday said, ""Apple's ecosystem in China remains very strong,"" with the average iPhone owner in China owning 2.5 Apple devices.

Several Wall Street analysts said the curbs showed that even a company with a large presence in China and good ties to the government is not immune to rising tension between the two nations. Apple has shifted some production out of China in the aftermath of the country's strict COVID-19 restrictions.

""The only way Apple could draw the ire of Beijing is moving supply chains out of China at a pace or to a degree Beijing feels uncomfortable with,"" Evercore ISI strategist Neo Wang said in a note.

""If that is the case, it shouldn’t be a surprise for Beijing to punish Apple by playing the ‘security’ card excessively. It is unclear whether what we are seeing now is part of this,"" Wang said.

Washington is trying to limit China's access to key advances, including cutting-edge chip technology, and Beijing wants to cut reliance on American tech.

A teardown by research firm TechInsights showed more China-made chip components in the Mate 60 Pro than previous models, a sign of Beijing's progress.

The U.S. Commerce Department is seeking more information on the ""character and composition"" of the new Huawei chip that may violate trade curbs, it said on Thursday.

By David Randall

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock investors are turning their focus to next week’s inflation data, which could determine the near-term path of an equity rally that has wobbled in recent weeks.

Signs the U.S. economy is on track for a so-called soft landing, where the Federal Reserve is able to bring down inflation without badly damaging growth, have helped power the S&P 500’s 16% year-to-date gain.

Last week’s employment data played into that narrative, showing the job market remained robust, though not strong enough to spark worries that the Fed would need to hike interest rates more to fight inflation, moves that rocked markets last year.

Consumer price data next week may need to strike a similar balance, investors said. Too high a number could fan fears of the Fed leaving interest rates higher for longer or hiking them more in coming months. That would give investors less reason to hold onto stocks after a tech-led drop in which the lost about 5% from summer highs.

""This inflation demon is far from being destroyed,"" said Michael Purves, head of Tallbacken Capital Advisors, who expects signs of higher inflation will weigh on the multiples of megacap growth names that have powered the rally. ""If we're hitting a structural shift with higher nominal GDP growth, that will come with some volatility and unintended consequences.""

Investors trying to assess future Fed policy will watch other data in the coming week too, including a reading of the producer price index and retail sales.

The U.S. central bank is widely expected to hold benchmark rates steady at its Sept. 20 meeting. Markets are also pricing in a nearly 44% chance of a rate hike at the Fed’s Nov. meeting, up from 28% a month ago.

""If we get a high inflation print we will see those expectations pick right up"" for September and November, said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for the Schwab Center for Financial Research.

OPTIMISTIC, BUT CAUTIOUS

Strategists and investors currently have largely held faith in the market despite stocks’ recent wobble. Some, though, are growing more cautious.

Reasons for optimism include the relative outperformance of the U.S. economy compared to Europe and China, and signs the so-called profit recession among S&P 500 companies may be over.

Still, worries over an economic slowdown in China and concerns that U.S. corporate margins will shrink have led some market participants to believe squeezing more gains out of stocks will grow more difficult.

The S&P 500 Information Technology sector lost more than 2% this week following news that Beijing had ordered central government employees to stop using iPhones for work. Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) fell 6% for the week on fears the company and its suppliers could take a hit from rising competition from China's Huawei.

""We think we are still in a bull market that will hit new highs before the end of the year, but it will be a choppy road,"" said Ed Clissold, Chief U.S. Strategist at Ned Davis Research.

The S&P 500 is down about 5% from its July highs, which has made stock valuations broadly more attractive given the low possibility of an imminent recession, said Jonathan Golub, senior equity strategist at Credit Suisse Securities.

Forward price to earnings multiples for 10 out of the 11 sector groups of the S&P 500 fell in August, he noted, though the P/E for the index as a whole remains near 20, compared with 17 at the end of 2022.

Still, much of the bull case for stocks hinges on softer inflation eventually pushing the Fed to lower interest rates.

""If we saw a further material rise in interest rates, the equity market would not take that well,"" said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/investor-hopes-for-us-soft-landing-ride-on-inflation-data-3171141,0.07,0.841,0.089,0.9352

Why Are Qualcomm (QCOM) Shares Soaring Today

QCOM +0.48% Add to/Remove from Watchlist AAPL +0.68% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

What Happened: Shares of wireless chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) jumped 9.29% in the pre-market session after the company announced an agreement with Apple (NASDAQ: ) to provide Snapdragon® 5G Modem-RF Systems for smartphone releases in 2024, 2025, and 2026. Qualcomm is the leading supplier of 5G modems, and this deal with Apple further cements its position in the market. Analysts have been concerned that Apple might be increasingly moving towards in-house production of some of its chipsets, which could have hurt Qualcomm's business. However, this deal shows that Apple is still committed to using Qualcomm's modems, which is a positive sign for investors. After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $109.43, up 3.1% from previous close.

Is now the time to buy Qualcomm? Find out by reading the original article on StockStory.

What is the market telling us: Qualcomm's shares are somewhat volatile and over the last year have had 13 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was four days ago, when the company dropped 6.06% on the news that stocks of chipmakers and other suppliers of components used to make Apple devices retreated amid recent reports suggesting China's intention to expand its prohibition of Apple device usage from government officials to state and federal agencies. For example, Qualcomm supplies some of the chips used in iPhones.This development has raised concerns among investors about the potential implications of the ban on the iPhone production supply chain and future demand from China, as the extent of these restrictions remains uncertain.

Qualcomm is up 2.09% since the beginning of the year, but at $109.43 per share it is still trading 21% below its 52-week high of $138.46 from January 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Qualcomm's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,510.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/why-are-qualcomm-qcom-shares-soaring-today-3171804,0.031,0.889,0.08,0.9001

The iPhone 15 Pro, unveiled by Apple (NASDAQ: ) on Tuesday, will support USB 3 data transfer speeds for the first time. However, customers won't be able to experience these higher speeds right out of the box due to Apple's decision to bundle a USB 2.0 cable with the device.

The USB-C port on the iPhone 15 Pro is capable of data transfer speeds up to 10 Gbits per second, according to Apple's announcement. This is a significant upgrade from the USB 2.0 speeds of 480 Mbits per second that the bundled cable supports. To unlock this higher speed, users will need to purchase an optional USB 3 cable.

Apple stated during its keynote that ""a new USB controller enables USB 3 speeds on iPhone for the first time, now supporting much higher transfer speeds and video output up to 4K at 60 fps HDR"". Despite this advancement, the company has chosen to ship a USB 2.0 cable with a type-C port with each device.

The company currently offers a Thunderbolt 4 cable on its site for $69, which can unlock these higher data transfer speeds. However, there may also be third-party vendors offering compatible cables in the future.

In addition to the new iPhones, Apple is launching a range of USB-C accessories, including charging cables with higher wattage and a USB-C to lightning dongle. Consumers looking for improved performance over the standard USB-C cable provided will need to invest in these additional products.

While the iPhone 15 also supports a USB-C port, it only offers USB 2.0 speeds. This distinction between the two models marks another step in Apple's ongoing strategy to differentiate its flagship Pro models from the standard offerings.

The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has no plans to build a packaging facility in the US, according to a report published on Wednesday, September 13, 2023. This decision could pose significant challenges to America's bid to become a global leader in chip production by the end of the decade. The absence of a local packaging facility implies that chips manufactured at TSMC's $40 billion Arizona fab, due for completion in 2025, will have to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging.

The TSMC Arizona fab is a crucial part of President Joe Biden's plan to design and produce leading-edge logic chips, as reported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2023. However, construction on the fab has been delayed due to a shortage of skilled US workers. Despite this, the fab remains integral to US infrastructure and military modernization efforts.

Last December, Apple (NASDAQ: ) announced it would become the Arizona fab's biggest customer. Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that these chips could be proudly stamped ""Made in America"". However, Dylan Patel, chief analyst at SemiAnalysis, argued that without a local packaging facility, the Arizona fab is effectively a paperweight and does not significantly contribute to America's advanced chip supplies.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) reported in 2021 that US semiconductor firms offshore almost all packaging processes, with only 46 facilities located domestically specializing in outsourced testing and assembly operations. Meanwhile, there are 107 such facilities in Taiwan and 111 in China—countries responsible for at least 81 percent of global chip assembly, packaging, and testing.

Apple hasn't specified how many chips it plans to purchase from the Arizona fab. The company might be planning to buy less advanced chips that could be packaged outside Taiwan for its iPads and MacBooks. However, more advanced chips used in the iPhone, Apple Watch, and advanced Mac desktops would still likely have to come from Taiwan.

TSMC employees told The Information that building a packaging facility in the US is unlikely due to high costs. Analysts also believe that the Arizona fab won't produce enough chips to justify TSMC building a packaging facility in the US. When fully operational, the fab will produce 600,000 wafers per year, a relatively small amount compared to the 15 million total wafers TSMC produced in 2022.

On Thursday, September 14, 2023, Dylan Patel reiterated his stance, stating that the TSMC Arizona fab will be little more than a paperweight in any geopolitical tension or war with China over Taiwan due to the need to send the chips back to Taiwan for packaging.

PARIS (Reuters) -Apple pledged on Friday to update software on iPhone 12s in France to settle a dispute over radiation levels, but concerns in other European countries signalled it may have to take similar action elsewhere.

France this week suspended sales of iPhone 12 handsets after tests which it said found breaches of radiation exposure limits.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) contested the findings, saying the iPhone 12 was certified by multiple international bodies as compliant with global standards, but said on Friday it would issue a software update to accommodate the testing methods used in France.

Researchers have conducted a vast number of studies over the last two decades to assess the health risks of mobile phones. According to the World Health Organisation, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by them.

But the radiation warning in France, based on results of tests that differ from those carried out in other countries, has prompted concerns across Europe.

Belgium's state secretary for digitalisation said he had asked Apple to upgrade the iPhone 12 software across EU countries, even though he said that based on the Belgian regulator's own preliminary review the handset presents no danger to users.

Germany said it was in touch with French authorities to find a European Union-wide solution, while Italy was set to ask Apple to upgrade the software on iPhone 12s there, according to a government source in Rome.

However, any request to Apple or separate decisions by Italian authorities will only come after the end of the French investigation, a second Italian government source said.

The Dutch Authority for Digital Infrastructure said it was also conducting its own investigation, due in two weeks, and was in contact with Apple as well as German and French authorities. The agency said it had received calls from concerned consumers.

The French government welcomed Apple's software update, saying it would be swiftly tested and should allow for sales of the relatively old iPhone 12 model, launched in 2020, to resume.

""We will issue a software update for users in France to accommodate the protocol used by French regulators. We look forward to iPhone 12 continuing to be available in France,"" Apple said in a statement.

""This is related to a specific testing protocol used by French regulators and not a safety concern,"" it said.

Apple routinely provides software updates for its phones and computers, mostly to fix a security issue. They can be focused on a particular model or a region, and sometimes Apple issues such updates several times in a month.

LIMB TESTS

France's Agence Nationale des Frequences (ANFR) said on Tuesday the iPhone 12's Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) - a measure of the rate of radiofrequency energy absorbed by the body from a piece of equipment - was higher than legally allowed, which prompted the sale suspension.

A change in French regulations in 2020 allowed for testing SAR for limbs - holding a phone in hand - as well as for the head and body, used elsewhere. In the French limb SAR tests, which the iPhone 12 failed, it is measured at a distance of 0 mm compared with a distance of 5mm for body tests.

The Belgian minister for digitalisation, Mathieu Michel, said in a statement on Friday that while a review of the phone by the country's IBPT regulator was still underway, the first results were ""reassuring"" and there was no need for a recall of the phone in Belgium.

Even so, he said he had contacted Apple and asked it to ""review its software updates in an identical manner within the whole of Europe.""

Denmark too moved to reassure owners of the phone, saying its Safety Authority would not take action following France's findings and that it was not concerned about radiation levels from using the iPhone 12.

""Based on the available information, the Danish Health Authority's assessment is that you can continue to use your iPhone 12 without concern,"" it said in an emailed statement.

Industry experts said there were no safety risks as regulatory limits, based on the risk of burns or heatstroke from the phone's radiation, were set well below levels where scientists have found evidence of harm.

""Ultimately I suspect the whole incident will be quickly forgotten,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, highlighting that the iPhone 12 is an old model.

Apple launched the iPhone 15 on Tuesday and the iPhone 12 is not available to buy from Apple directly. It can, however, be bought from third parties that have inventory or trade old phones.

A bigger issue would have been a potential recall, which France had threatened if Apple had refused to do a software update.

Apple's revenues totalled about $95 billion in Europe last year, making the region its second biggest behind the Americas. Some estimates say it sold more than 50 million iPhones last year in Europe.

Softbank's Arm Holdings

Chip design outfit Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) saw a heavily oversubscribed IPO in US markets Thursday, with its valuation also racing past initial projections.

Shares of Arm, a unit of Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (TYO: ) (OTC: ), surged some 25% to $63.59 on their first day of trade in the US, making for about a $65 billion market cap - far higher than the $54B valuation projected in the offering.

Gains spilled over into Softbank's Tokyo shares Friday, which closed the session up 2.1% to 6,718 yen. In New York, Softbank ADRs ticked 0.9% higher on Thursday before retreating 2.4% on Friday. Softbank retains 90% ownership of the company.

The Arm debut is the year's biggest, and saw many of the chip designer’s biggest clients participating as cornerstone investors. Apple (NASDAQ: , Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) were among the biggest investors in the firm.

Arm’s listing marks the close of a long-running attempt by Softbank to cash out on the chip designer. The conglomerate had agreed to sell Arm to Nvidia for $40B in 2021, although the plan was scuttled due to regulatory hurdles.

Demand for Arm’s IPO was also largely underpinned by growing optimism over an AI boom this year, which chipmakers such as Nvidia predict will fuel a major bump in chip demand over the coming years.

Apple iPhones titanium

Apple (NASDAQ: ) launched its iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models last Tuesday, as well as the higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.

Apple also unveiled new Apple Watch constructed with 95% titanium and boasting 72 hours of battery life.

The Pro Max - the most expensive of the new iPhones - went on sale for pre-orders on Friday, and initial delivery times for the model slipped into October, according to Bloomberg, suggesting strong demand.

The potentially strong demand is a positive for investors, with concerns emerging in recent weeks regarding overall iPhone demand, particularly regarding the consumer appetite for Apple iPhones in China following the launch of Huawei's new smartphone.

Following the event, Morgan Stanley noted that China risk ""continues to dominate investor conversations,"" but added, ""We still believe there is upside to FY24 expectations.”

Goldman Sachs, for its part, said:

“Although the product announcements and key features were largely as expected, price increases on iPhone were lower-than-expected… We're encouraged by Apple's continued investments into the Apple ecosystem and US carrier promotions for the iPhone continue to be supportive of demand.”

Shares of Apple slipped 2.9% for the week to $175.01.

Qualcomm signs with Apple

A day earlier, and in other Apple-related news, Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: ) said that it had secured an agreement to provide its high-end chips for Apple iPhones to be launched from 2024 through 2026

Shares in the chipmaker jumped nearly 4% on the announcement.

After the announcement, Deutsche Bank maintained its a Hold rating and $120.00 price target on Qualcomm, noting that the development is ""clearly a positive for QCOM, with eventual AAPL loss now not expected until 2026 at the earliest (vs. prior expectations of 2024).""

The analysts said the estimate the total associated opportunity to come to some $9B a year.

""Overall, this announcement highlights the true value QCOM’s superior technology, and we agree the stock should rise in response,"" said Deutsche, while adding that they are reiterating the Hold rating in part due to ""ongoing pressures in the total smartphone market and the potential for only incremental opex improvements now that AAPL biz must be maintained.""

Shares ended 1.7% higher for the week.





Oracle revenue

Oracle (NYSE: ) shares plunged more than 13% on Tuesday after management offered a weak outlook for the second quarter on its fiscal first-quarter earnings call.

Q1 results beat analysts' forecasts, reporting earnings per share of $1.19 vs. the expected $1.15 and $12.45B in sales, given boosted demand for cloud services amid an ongoing push to develop generative AI apps.

But on the call, Oracle said it sees total revenue growing 5% to 7% at today's currency rates and 3% to 5% in constant currency. Cloud revenue is seen growing at 28% in constant currency, below the 29% reported for Q1. Oracle attributed the soft cloud outlook to the accelerated transition of its Cerner (NASDAQ: ) unit to the cloud.

Adjusted EPS is seen at $1.29 (up or down 2 cents), above the $1.25 consensus.

Goldman Sachs said the company's Q2 outlook ""fell short of lofty expectations.""

""While the print/guide is unlikely to dissuade bulls, we see the current risk/reward skew as balanced in lieu of upside to near-term expects given an already demanding valuation profile,"" Rangan wrote in a note.

For Guggenheim, however, the Oracle bullish thesis remains intact:

""We see little risk in achieving F2Q goals, especially given the $1.5B in bookings in the first week of the quarter. Do these results change our thesis on ORCL? No. We continue to believe that the three legs of growth either still have much to go (SaaS), are at a very early stage (OCI), or are only just beginning (On Prem database migration to the Cloud). We reiterate ORCL as Buy rated and our Best Idea.""

Shares ended the week at $113.91, down more than 10% for the five sessions.

Tesla upgraded

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) soared 10% Monday on word of an upgrade to Overweight from Morgan Stanley, whose analysts said the stock can surge thanks to its Dojo Supercomputer.

Tesla stock is also a new Top Pick at Morgan Stanley with a price target of $400 per share, a new Street high.

The analysts wrote in a new to clients that the company's ""advanced supercomputing architecture... pushes new boundaries in custom silicon and may put Tesla at an asymmetric advantage in a $10trn TAM.""

The analysts liken Tesla to Amazon (NASDAQ: ) after the e-commerce titan’s AWS was able to reach 70% of the company’s total earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and says Dojo can add up to $500B to Tesla's enterprise value.

Tesla created Dojo, a dedicated supercomputer, to enhance and train its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. Tesla's vehicles are equipped with numerous sensors and must make critical real-time decisions in unpredictable driving conditions.

“While it is difficult to explicitly validate the many claims Tesla has made about Dojo's cost and performance, we believe Tesla has a chance of bringing forth a competitive customized solution given the company's innovation track record and capabilities,” Morgan Stanley further noted.

Year to date, Tesla shares are up over 150% to $274.39.

AAPL +0.68% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Despite rising inflation and interest rates, Apple (NASDAQ: )'s premium iPhone 15 models are witnessing strong demand, according to market analysts. This trend is indicated by extended shipping delays for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models, as reported on Tuesday by Michael Ng, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.

Ng's research note on Monday highlighted that the pricier Pro models are experiencing longer shipping times compared to the more affordable base models of the smartphone. This suggests a supply-demand imbalance where demand is surpassing supply. However, Ng also cautioned about potential supply chain constraints, particularly for the Pro Max model. He maintains a ""Buy"" rating on Apple's stock with a price target of $216.

Apple's website confirms some of these delays. It shows that deliveries for certain colors of the iPhone 15 Pro Max are postponed until mid-November. However, Apple has not yet commented on this matter.

The success of the new iPhone is crucial for Apple's financial performance. In 2022, iPhone sales accounted for $205.5 billion out of Apple's total revenue of $394.3 billion. Therefore, any disappointment in sales could significantly impact the company's earnings.

On Friday, Amit Daryanani, an analyst at Evercore ISI, shared similar observations in his note. He pointed out data indicating strong demand for the iPhone 15 Pro Max. However, he also noted a slight dip in demand for the Pro/Plus models compared to last year. This could affect overall sales volumes but might be somewhat offset by higher prices for other models. Daryanani rates Apple as ""Outperform"" with a $210 price target.

Despite this robust demand and positive ratings from analysts, Apple's shares were down slightly by 0.2% on Tuesday to $177.59, even though they have risen by 37% this year.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks slumped on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve held key interest rates unchanged as widely expected, and revised economic projections higher with warnings that the battle against inflation was far from over.

All three major U.S. stock indexes retreated in the wake of announcement, with interest rate sensitive megacap stocks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: ) pulling the Nasdaq down most.

The Fed's announcement was accompanied by its Summary Economic Projections (SEP) and dot plot, which sees an additional 25 basis point rate hike this year, peaking in the 5.50%-5.75% range.

The SEP projections also called for 50 basis points of rate cuts next year.

""It’s your standard Fed day volatility,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha, Nebraska. ""Yet it wasn’t really a curve-ball event, because markets took things in stride.""

""This day has had a bull's eye on it all month and now we can move past it,"" Detrick added.

The updated projections see the Fed funds target rate edging down to 5.1% by the end of next year, and to 3.9% by the end of 2025.

Since the Fed began tightening in March, core inflation has cooled. But its slow descent toward the central bank's 2% target has been slow and uneven.

The SEP forecasts inflation to drop to 3.3% by year-end, and to approach the central bank's average annual 2% target.

At the subsequent press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell tempered rosier economic projections with a warning that inflation has a long way to go before reaching that target.

""The Fed didn’t really rock the boat,"" Detrick said. ""They acknowledged the strength in the economy, which also lowered the number of cuts that were expected next year, implying higher for longer is likely the path they will continue to take.""

The fell 76.85 points, or 0.22%, to 34,440.88, the lost 41.75 points, or 0.94%, to 4,402.2 and the dropped 209.06 points, or 1.53%, to 13,469.13.

Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, interest rate sensitive communication services and technology suffered the largest percentage losses.

Marketing automation company Klaviyo advanced 9.2% in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, the third recent initial public offering in recent days, following Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) and Maplebear Inc.

""It shows confidence is coming back to even have the large IPOS,"" Detrick said. ""It's a sign that things are getting closer to normal which is something that is necessary at this stage of the business cycle.""

Maplebear lost 10.7%, while fellow recent debut Arm Holdings was down 4.1%.

Pinterest (NYSE: ) added 3.1% after the image-sharing firm announced a share buyback of up to $1 billion.

Coty (NYSE: ) gained 4.4% after the CoverGirl parent hiked its annual core sales forecast.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street see-sawed to a lower close on Friday, capping a tumultuous week during which benchmark Treasury yields hit 16-year highs and investors digested the Federal Reserve's hawkish outlook revisions.

All three major U.S. stock indexes oscillated for much of the session but ended red.

All three posted weekly losses, with the and the Nasdaq registering their largest Friday-to-Friday percentage drops since March.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 dipped below its 100-day moving average - a key support level - for the first time since March, Its failure to break above that level suggests the index is still under downward pressure.

""This week is about some Fed messaging colliding with overly optimistic equity investors,"" said Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Hill added that investors have ""wanted to trade peak interest rates for almost a year now."" But he said it was clear in remarks this week by Fed Chair Jerome Powell ""and in the dot plot that the Fed doesn't think we’re there yet.""

""This week’s stock action has been about digesting that reality.""

Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields retreated from 16-year highs as investors turned their focus from hawkish Fed guidance to key economic data waiting in the wings.

Investors were still digesting the Fed's decision to let its key interest rate stand, but update its quarterly Summary Economic Projections to suggest restrictive monetary policy will remain in place longer than previously anticipated.

On Friday, remarks from Fed Governor Michelle Bowman supported the FOMC hawks, suggesting the Fed funds target rate should be raised further and held ""at a restrictive level for some time"" to bring inflation down to the central bank's 2% target.

""There are a lot of factors working against a soft landing and that’s something the Fed needs to be reminded of, because pushing rates higher could push us into recession,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.

The fell 106.58 points, or 0.31%, to 33,963.84, the S&P 500 lost 9.94 points, or 0.23%, to 4,320.06 and the dropped 12.18 points, or 0.09%, to 13,211.81.

Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, consumer discretionary suffered the steepest percentage loss, while tech and energy were the only gainers.

Ford Motor (NYSE: ) Co gained 1.9% after the striking United Auto Workers union reported progress in talks with the automaker.

Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) added 1.7% in the wake Britain's antitrust regulator's statement that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: )'s restructured $69 billion acquisition of the company by ""opens the door"" to the biggest-ever gaming deal being cleared.

U.S.-listed shares of Chinese firms including PDD Holdings, JD (NASDAQ: ).com, Li Auto and Baidu (NASDAQ: ) rose between 2% and 4% on signs of an economic a rebound, while Alibaba (NYSE: ) jumped 5.0% after Bloomberg reported that report the company's logistics arm Cainiao was planning to file for a Hong Kong IPO as soon as next week.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will defer an import licence requirement for laptops and tablets, two government officials said, a policy U-turn after industry and the U.S. government complained about the move, which could hit Apple (NASDAQ: ), Samsung (KS: ) and others.

The plan will be delayed by a year, after which the government will consider whether to implement a licensing regime or not, one of the officials told Reuters, requesting anonymity.

The licensing regime, announced abruptly on Aug. 3, aimed to ""ensure trusted hardware and systems"" enter India, reduce dependence on imports, boost local manufacturing and in part address the country's trade imbalance with China.

But following industry objections, the initial plan was quickly delayed by about three months.

Last month U.S. trade chief Katherine Tai raised concerns with India over the move, which would also affect companies such as Dell (NYSE: ) and HP (NYSE: ).

India's electronics ministry is now proposing a simpler import registration process that is due to start in November, said the officials, who have direct knowledge of the discussions.

A representative for India's IT ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The new 'imports management system' will need companies to obtain 'registration certificates' for imports of laptops, tablets and personal computers, instead of licences proposed earlier by the Aug.3 order, one of the officials said.

The ministry conveyed the proposal to industry officials in a meeting on Friday, they added.

Asian stock markets are preparing for a cautious commencement to the week today, as investors evaluate the potential impact of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy stance. Japanese futures remained steady on Sunday, while Australian futures and Hong Kong stock contracts experienced slight declines. In contrast, an index of U.S.-listed Chinese companies saw an increase, following the announcement that Washington and Beijing are setting up working groups to discuss economic and financial matters.

In early Monday trading in Asia, rose by 0.2%, recovering from Friday's equivalent fall that marked its poorest week since March. also increased by 0.2%, buoyed by Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).'s latest product sales which contributed to the stability of the underlying index on Friday.

The upcoming week will see U.S. Treasuries once again under scrutiny due to scheduled public appearances by Federal Reserve officials. Investors are also awaiting key U.S. inflation data and assessing the potential implications of a possible U.S. government shutdown.

According to market analyst Fawad Razaqzada from City Index and Forex.com, traders remain wary about inflation and policy direction in light of the recent oil surge and the Fed's hint that interest rates will not decrease in the near future.

Two Federal Reserve officials suggested last week that at least one more rate hike could be forthcoming, with borrowing costs potentially needing to stay high for a longer period for inflation to return to its 2% target. Boston Fed President Susan Collins did not rule out further tightening, while Governor Michelle Bowman suggested that more than one increase might be necessary, reinforcing her status as one of the Federal Open Market Committee's most hawkish members.

San Francisco Fed Bank President Mary Daly stated last week that it is premature to claim victory over inflation, reaffirming the central bank's continued commitment to manage price pressures as smoothly as possible.

Bank of America Corp (NYSE: )'s rate strategists predict that the yield on 10-year Treasuries could reach 4.75% before softer risk sentiment and tighter financial conditions drive it down by year-end.

In other market news, oil prices are approaching their annual high, while remained steady around $26,500.

The week ahead is packed with key events including speeches by Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and ECB's Francois Villeroy de Galhau on Monday. This will be followed by the release of U.S. new home sales data and Conference Board consumer confidence on Tuesday, with ECB's Philip Lane also scheduled to speak.

Similar AI services like Siri, Google voice assistant and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: )'s Alexa are integrated with the devices they run on and are often used to set alarms and reminders, and deliver information off the internet.

Since its debut last year, ChatGPT has been adopted by companies for a wide range of tasks from summarizing documents to writing computer code, setting off a race amongst Big Tech companies to launch their own offerings based on generative AI.

ChatGPT's new voice feature can also narrate bedtime stories, settle debates at the dinner table, and speak out loud text input from users.

The technology behind it is being used by Spotify (NYSE: ) for the platform's podcasters to translate their content in different languages, OpenAI said.

With images support, users can take pictures of things around them and ask the chatbot to ""troubleshoot why your grill won't start, explore the contents of your fridge to plan a meal, or analyze a complex graph for work-related data"".

Treasury yields remained at their highest level in more than decade, with the at close to 4.54%, after JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon warned that the Federal Reserve could lift rates to 7%.

“I am not sure if the world is prepared for 7%,” Dimon told The Times of India in an interview. “I ask people in business, ‘Are you prepared for something like 7%?’ The worst case is 7% with stagflation.

Big tech resumed its slide after brief respite on Monday as investors continue to price in the pain for growth stocks amid the prospect of higher for longer interest rate regime.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) fell more than 2% to lead big tech lower, followed by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) as higher rates make future profit appear less valuable, and the impact is particularly acute in higher-priced growth sectors including tech.

(Reuters) - Epic Games on Wednesday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the antitrust case it brought against Apple (NASDAQ: ), hoping to reverse lower court rulings that have found the iPhone maker has not violated antitrust laws.

""Fortnite"" owner Epic has waged a multi-year legal battle against Apple alleging its App Store, where developers pay commissions of up to 30% on in-app purchases, violates U.S. antitrust laws. In 2021, a trial court ruled Apple's App Store does not break antitrust laws.

But the lower court said a provision that prevents developers from providing users with a link to other third-party payment methods violated a California unfair competition law. Apple was ordered to change that practice, but those orders have been on hold while the appeal plays out.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's ruling, and the U.S. Supreme Court has already refused an emergency bid by Epic to enact the lower court ruling about changing App Store rules, saying they must remain on hold.

Epic's filing on Wednesday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to clarify several complex areas of antitrust law.

The trial court found Apple's practices do in fact reduce competition in the software market, but found in favor of Apple's arguments that those anticompetitive effects are offset by its efforts to keep iPhones secure.

Epic has argued the trial court performed that legal balancing test incorrectly.

(Reuters) - The eked out a fractional gain on Wednesday after a see-saw session, as investors weighed whether to start bargain hunting following a sell-off fueled by elevated Treasury yields and uncertainty about the path ahead for interest rates.

Investors were also attuned to developments in Washington as divisions among U.S. lawmakers put the federal government at risk of a partial shutdown by the weekend.

A possible shutdown has added to worries for stock investors as they grapple with benchmark Treasury yields that have climbed to 16-year highs after the Federal Reserve last week signaled a hawkish long-term path for interest rates.

At the same time, as the S&P 500 has sharply pared its year-to-date gain, some investors are wondering if the market is close to a bottom.

""At some point people will start to buy stocks for the fourth quarter, and the third-quarter selling might be almost done,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel.

""At a certain level, people are going to get back in thinking the fourth quarter might be a pretty good one.""

The fell 68.61 points, or 0.2%, to 33,550.27, the S&P 500 gained 0.98 points, or 0.02%, at 4,274.51 and the rose 29.24 points, or 0.22%, to 13,092.85.

During the session, the S&P 500 rose as much as 0.4% and fell as much as 0.8% before paring losses.

Among S&P 500 sectors, the rate-sensitive utilities group fell most, dropping 1.9%. Energy rose 2.5%, as breached $97 a barrel, with the jump in oil prices posing a renewed threat to inflation that has been moderating.

The S&P 500 has fallen about 7% since late July, but remains up over 11% for 2023.

""Investors are looking for a turning point,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. ""Clearly, it is not going to take much of a breath of fresh air in this market for people to chase this.""

In Washington, Republican U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy rejected a stopgap funding bill advancing in the Senate, bringing the government closer to its fourth partial shutdown in a decade.

Data on Wednesday showed orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose in August while business spending on equipment appeared to regain momentum after faltering early in the third quarter.

Investors are focusing on Friday's monthly personal consumption expenditures price index for a fresh view of inflation. This week also brings second-quarter Gross Domestic Product and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

In company news, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: ) shares rose 1.9% after the retailer topped market estimates for quarterly revenue and profit.

Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iPhone 15 models, released this year with a USB-C port enabling compatibility with USB-C cables and power banks, are reportedly experiencing charging issues with certain USB-C battery packs. The problem was first highlighted on Friday on Reddit and the MacRumors forums.

The charging issue seems to stem from the iPhone's reverse charging feature, which allows the device to charge an Apple Watch, AirPods, or another iPhone through its USB-C port. This feature is possibly causing some existing USB-C power banks to be incompatible with the iPhone 15 models. In some instances, the iPhone fails to charge or ends up charging the power bank instead.

The issue impacts a range of power banks, making it challenging to compile a comprehensive list of non-functional models due to the vast number of them in the market. It has been confirmed that one version that does not work is the Anker PowerCore Slim 10K PD.

A customer who contacted Anker was informed that the only way to get the power bank to charge the iPhone is to use the USB-A port. Anker's statement suggested that the reverse charging function of the iPhone 15 series influences the USB C's port charging of their PowerCore Slim 10K PD model. The company has pledged to conduct further tests on all their power banks to determine if this is an issue with specific models and seek a solution.

Despite these concerns, most USB-C power banks with Power Delivery seem to be functioning as expected. Several models tested by MacRumors confirmed this. iPhone 15 owners should be aware of potential incompatibility issues with some power banks.

While this issue is being addressed, it's important to note that Apple, with a market capitalization of $2670.0 billion as provided by InvestingPro data, continues to be a significant player in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. The company's performance has been impressive, yielding high returns on invested capital and a high return on assets of 28.23%, as per InvestingPro Tips. This strong performance has allowed Apple to maintain dividend payments for 12 consecutive years, with a growth rate of 4.35% as per InvestingPro's real-time metrics.

Despite a slight decline in revenue growth of -0.93%, Apple's revenue for the last twelve months (LTM2023.Q3) stood at a staggering $383.93 billion. The company also operates with a moderate level of debt, ensuring that cash flows can sufficiently cover interest payments.

By Juby Babu

(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: ) on Saturday said it has identified a few issues which can cause new iPhones to run warmer than expected, including a bug in the iOS 17 software which will be fixed in an upcoming update.

After complaints that the new phones are getting very warm, Apple has said that the device may feel warmer in the first few days ""after setting up or restoring the device because of increased background activity.""

""Another issue involves some recent updates to third-party apps that are causing them to overload the system,"" Apple said, adding that it is working with app developers on fixes that are in the process of being rolled out.

The third-party apps causing the issue include game Asphalt 9; Meta (NASDAQ: )'s Instagram; and Uber (NYSE: ), according to the company. Instagram already fixed the issue with its app on Sept. 27.

The upcoming iOS 17 bug fix will not reduce performance to address the iPhone's temperature.

The Cupertino, California-headquartered company said that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max do not suffer from overheating due to the design, rather the new titanium shells result in improved heat dissipation compared to prior stainless steel models.

Apple also said the issue is not a safety or injury risk, and will not impact the phone's long-term performance.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-identifies-issues-causing-overheating-in-the-iphone-15-3187316,0.033,0.901,0.066,0.8197

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the biggest headlines out of a big earnings week for tech: Meta AI wows analysts, Micron forecasts a big loss, Amazon is sued by the FTC, Apple dealing with scorching iPhone temps.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Analysts cheered by Meta's freshest AI innovations

Wall Street analysts are positive on Meta (NASDAQ: ) after the company unveiled new artificial intelligence (AI) features and showcased its latest range of head-worn devices at its annual “Connect” developers conference this past week.

The new products include AI-enabled Ray-Ban smart glasses that can livestream what a user is seeing directly to Facebook and Instagram, as well as a newly updated virtual-reality headset. The company also presented a new AI chatbot and a studio for developers to create brand-specific chatbots.

Analysts are particularly optimistic about the AI potential.

Oppenheimer wrote that the updates show that the company ""understands investors want more focus on AI vs. the Metaverse,"" reiterating its Outperform rating on the company, and Evercore analysts said of the smart glasses: ""All in, this is a solid update, and we believe an important step towards mass adoption of AR/VR technology.""

UBS said it was ""positively surprised by the level of innovation going on at Meta, the series of products likely to boost engagement, and a clear path to medium-term monetization potential of genAI products.""

And Bank of America said the event ""offered early signs on how Meta will use AI to help drive user engagement (chat and image creation) and new business services,"" adding, ""We expect a number of AI based advertiser tools to help with ad creation and campaign management as well.”

Meta shares gained 1.6% for the week to $300.21.

Amazon accused of wielding 'monopoly power' by FTC in new antitrust lawsuit; invests in ChatGPT rival

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) took a fall Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission launched a landmark anti-trust lawsuit against the $1.3 trillion e-commerce giant, but some analysts have maintained their positive outlook on the company.

The FTC's long-awaited complaint alleges that Amazon is a monopoly that maintains its power by employing anticompetitive and unfair practices. In particular, the FTC accused the company of harnessing its dominant market position to fight efforts by sellers on its online marketplace to charge cheaper prices on rival platforms.

FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has long advocated for a sweeping crackdown on Big Tech firms, declined to discuss a possible break-up of Amazon in a press briefing on Tuesday. Instead, she said, the focus is on ""liability.""

Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky, meanwhile, argued that the practices targeted by the FTC have actually produced ""greater selection, lower prices, and faster delivery speeds"" for customers and ""greater opportunity"" for businesses.

Considering the case, analysts at Telsey Advisory Group said that while they ""understand"" the FTC is concerned about the costs Amazon extracts from sellers, they believe it could be ""hard to argue"" with the tech group's response that sellers have multiple options to transact. The analysts maintained their outperform rating of the stock, adding that they expect it to still be a ""share gainer.""

Analysts at Bank of America and Citi also reiterated their respective buy ratings, arguing that Amazon's core operations could help offset fears around the outcome of the lawsuit.

CFRA likewise maintained its Buy rating on Amazon and said it believes the lawsuit ""will be a lengthy and uphill battle for the FTC."" Along with Wedbush, it believes major structural changes in the company are unlikely. Wedbush added, ""Consistent with our view ahead of the lawsuit’s filing, we would be buyers of the pullback in shares.""

Amazon ultimately recovered some of its Tuesday losses and ended down 1.8% for the week to $127.12.

Separately, Amazon also announced in the past week that it is aiming to invest up to $4B in artificial intelligence group Anthropic, rival to ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, aiming to bolster its position in the corporate arms race over nascent AI technology.

Under the terms of the agreement, Amazon says an initial investment of $1.25B could expand to $4B depending on certain conditions. Anthropic will then have access to Amazon's cloud computing platform to help optimize its AI systems, known as large language models.





Micron loses ground on shaky outlook

Micron (NASDAQ: ) reported Wednesday better-than-feared fiscal fourth-quarter , but a mixed picture on the outlook for the first quarter amid a challenging backdrop as the chip supply glut continued to keep a lid on demand.

Micron reported an adjusted loss of $1.07 a share, $0.08 better than anticipated, on above-par revenue of $4.01 billion.

For the fiscal first quarter, however, the company guided for a loss in a range of $1 to $1.14 a share versus consensus for $0.92 in the red, and revenue of $4.2B to $4.6B that comes in well below the $4.22B consensus.

JPMorgan raised the price target by $5 to $80 per share on MU, maintaining its Overweight rating, citing the beginning of an ""upturn"" in the memory industry and saying it believes Micron shares will rise through the rest of the year and into next ""as the market continues to discount improving revenue/pricing/margin/earnings power.""

Goldman Sachs commented in a similar manner:

""Despite what now appears to be a slower than previously expected recovery in gross margins and EPS, our constructive thesis on the stock predicated on improving demand and supply discipline (i.e. reduction in Wafer Fab Equipment spending and wafer starts) remains unchanged and, as such, we would view any pullback in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.""

Shares lost 4.4% on Thursday after the report, but clawed back those losses on Friday and ended down just fractionally for the week to $68.03.

Apple iPhones overheating: report

The new Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhone 15, particularly the high-end models, is facing overheating issues, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

The concerns, which echo similar ones for iPhone14 Pro, have been raised in consumer social media posts as well as reviews and tests conducted by the WSJ - the latter of which showed the iPhone 15 Pro Max reached temperatures as high as 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41C) while charging, and up to 112 degrees (44C), when charging coincides with processor-intensive activities such as gaming.

Apple may need to address these overheating issues through software updates, potentially impacting device performance.

Premium iPhones have traditionally been a significant source of revenue for Apple, especially as global smartphone demand has seen a decline. The company is pinning hopes on the iPhone 15, particularly its Pro variants, to rejuvenate its business and drive growth.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Dutch competition watchdog ACM on Monday said it had rejected objections by Apple (NASDAQ: ) against fines of 50 million euros ($53 million) it gave the company over failure to comply with orders to limit the dominant position of Apple's App Store.

The ACM said Apple has complied with most of its demands to open its App Store to alternative forms of payment for dating apps in the Netherlands, but had not met an undisclosed third element of the conditions related to the fines.

The ACM in 2021 ruled that Apple violated Dutch competition laws in the dating app market and required Apple to allow developers of dating apps to use third-party payment processors.

It fined Apple 5 million euros per week, eventually reaching 50 million euros during the period it failed to comply.

Apple objected to these fines, saying that the regulator had incorrectly defined relevant markets and had overestimated the dominance of Apple's position in the dating app market.

The regulator rejected all of Apple's objections in a decision dated July 13, 2023, which was published on Monday.

""We disagree with the ACM’s original order, which degrades investment incentives and is not in the best interests of our users’ privacy or data security,"" Apple said in a response.

""As the ACM has denied our administrative appeal, we will appeal to the Netherlands courts.”

The ACM said it would publish the still-undisclosed part of the proceedings objected to by Apple if it won in court.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The closed at its lowest level since June 1 on Tuesday as economic data underscored the view the Federal Reserve may need to keep interest rates high.

The Dow turned negative for the year for the first time since June and ended at its lowest level since May 31. The Nasdaq also closed at its lowest since May 31.

Data showed U.S. job openings unexpectedly increased in August, fueling worries about a tight labor market ahead of Friday's key U.S. monthly jobs report.

Investors continue to closely watch benchmark Treasury yields, which hit 16-year highs on Tuesday.

""The scenario that most investors were assuming is the Fed would need to ultimately cut short-term rates, and we would return to a favorable interest rate environment,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.

""But investors are seeing a different scenario now - higher rates for longer.""

Higher borrowing costs are a negative for businesses and consumers.

All but one S&P 500 sector - utilities - were lower on the day, led by declines in consumer discretionary and technology. Growth companies tend to be among the hardest hit by rising yields.

The fell 430.97 points, or 1.29%, to 33,002.38, the S&P 500 lost 58.94 points, or 1.37%, at 4,229.45 and the dropped 248.31 points, or 1.87%, to 13,059.47.

The CBOE volatility index, Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" hit its highest close since May 24.

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said there is no urgency for the central bank to raise its policy rate again, but it will likely be ""a long time"" before rate cuts are appropriate. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she is open to raising rates again, potentially at the bank's next meeting.

Shares of Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) dropped after Reuters reported British media regulator Ofcom will push for an antitrust investigation into the companies' dominance of the UK cloud computing market.

Investors are getting ready for U.S. companies in the coming weeks to begin reporting on the last quarter, with some hoping the results could provide some positive news again for the market.

While the Dow is down 0.4% for the year, the Nasdaq remains up about 25% since Dec. 31 after a rally driven by enthusiasm over artificial intelligence.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.16 billion shares, compared with the 10.57 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) -Apple held talks with DuckDuckGo to replace Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google as the default search engine for the private mode on Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Safari browser, the Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the discussions.

The details of the talks are expected to be released later this week, according to the report, after Judge Amit Mehta, overseeing a federal antitrust suit against Google, ruled on Wednesday that he would unseal the testimony of DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg and Apple executive John Giannandrea.

The talks about potential deals between Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Apple and DuckDuckGo and Apple will be unsealed, the report said, citing Mehta in an order from the bench.

Apple, DuckDuckGo and Google did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice in a landmark U.S. trial argued Google, which has some 90% of the search market, illegally paid $10 billion annually to smartphone makers such as Apple and wireless carriers like AT&T (NYSE: ) and others to be the default in search on their devices in order to stay on top.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified on Monday, saying that tech giants were competing for vast troves of content needed to train artificial intelligence, and complained Google was locking up content with expensive and exclusive deals with publishers.

He added that Microsoft had sought to make its Bing search engine the default on Apple smartphones but was rebuffed.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-considered-switching-to-duckduckgo-from-google-for-safari--bloomberg-news-3190716,0.013,0.945,0.042,0.5346

Tesla's delivery miss, newest price cuts

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) on Monday missed EV delivery estimates after summer upgrades to its factories, reporting 435,059 vehicles in Q3 vs. Wall Street expectations for 456,722.

On the production side, the EV giant manufactured a total of 430,488 vehicles during the quarter, below the estimate of 461,992. Tesla said it expected a drop from Q2 as it made upgrades to facilities, adding, ""Our 2023 volume target of around 1.8 million vehicles remains unchanged.""

Wedbush Securities, which has an Outperform rating on Tesla shares, blamed the miss on longer-than-expected downtimes of factories in Shanghai and Austin, Texas, that it says forced the shift of some 20,000 units into the fourth quarter, based on its estimates.

""We believe Tesla is now set to be entering the next stage of growth for the company globally with the Model 3 refresh front and center in China and Cybertruck production set to kick off beginning around Halloween,"" Wedbush said in a note on Monday, calling them tailwinds for the stock going into the next year.

Later in the week, the company also announced it would once again reduce prices on some of its popular EVs in the US, cutting its price on the Model 3 sedan to $38,990 from $40,240, and on its long-range Model 3 to $45,990 from the prior $47,240.

The performance model's price tag has been reduced to $50,990 from $53,240, and the Model Y performance sport utility vehicle saw a price reduction to $52,490 from $54,490.

Tesla shares initially took a hit on both of these pieces of news, but ultimately gained ground for the full week, rising 6.4% to $260.53 from Monday's open. Shares are also up some 140% year to date.

Netflix eyes price bump after actors strike: report

According to The Wall Street Journal, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) plans to again hike the price of its ad-free service in several markets globally just a few months after the Hollywood actors' strike ends.

Citing sources familiar with the matter, the WSJ said it believes Netflix will likely begin the price bumps in the US and Canada, although they are unsure how much the price will be lifted by or when they will take effect.

The move would come amid a number of price hikes among streaming companies as they aim to improve profitability without alienating customers, with the WSJ calculating a 25% rise in major ad-free streaming services over the past year.

Netflix was up 1.2% for the week to $381.51 from Monday's open.





Rivian sinks on debt offering and preliminary numbers

Shares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: ) plunged some 23% Thursday after the EV maker announced a $1.5 billion green convertible senior unsecured note offering the previous night, along with disappointing preliminary Q3 results.

The debt offering, expected to extend the company's cash runway through 2025, includes an option for an additional $225 million. The notes can be redeemed for cash between October 2027 and September 2030, subject to specific share price performance conditions.

The company also said it currently expects Q3 sales to come in between $1.29B and $1.33B, slightly below market expectations.

Still, Truist remains bullish with a Buy rating and $30 price target on the stock, writing that the announcement ""largely falls in line with expectations & represents RIVN's strategy of continued opportunistic capital raises.”

They did add that they would not be surprised by a pullback, but added, ""with most of the unknowns out of the way, we see an increasingly positive setup into the 3Q print.”

Overall, the shares lost 20.7% for the week to $18.92 from Monday's opening price.

Apple changing App Store rules as China tightens grip

Starting recently, Apple (NASDAQ: ) is now mandating that new apps must provide proof of a Chinese government license before they can be published on its platform.

The move aligns Apple with local competitors that had already adopted this policy years ago to comply with China's increasingly strict regulatory environment.

Obtaining the newly required ""internet content provider (ICP) filing"" license typically involves having a presence in China or collaborating with a local publisher, posing challenges for numerous foreign app developers.

Apple had previously maintained a more lenient approach to ICP filings, which allowed it to offer a more extensive selection of mobile apps compared to local rivals and contributed to Apple's popularity in China, its third-largest market.

Shares are up 3.7% to $177.49 for the week vs. its Monday open.

By Josh Ye

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China aims to boost the country’s aggregate computing power by more than 50% by 2025, according to a plan released by authorities on Monday, as Beijing tightens its focus on supercomputing and artificial intelligence innovations.

The plan comes amid rising competition between China and the U.S. in many high-tech areas ranging from semiconductors and supercomputers to AI, including U.S. export controls on chipmaking equipment.

The plan, released by six departments in Beijing including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), has set a target for China’s total computing power to reach 300 EFLOPS by 2025. EFLOPS, equal to one quintillion floating-point operations per second, measures a computer's speed.

The MIIT revealed in August that China’s computing power has reached 197 EFLOPS this year, up from 180 EFLOPS in 2022. The ministry said it ranks China as second behind the United States, but did not elaborate on the scale of the U.S. computing power it referenced.

As AI training requires a large amount of computation, the effort to expand the supply of computing power is increasingly becoming a focus for Beijing.

According to a blog post by Google (NASDAQ: ) last month, the world’s top-tier generative AI models ""will require tens of EFLOPs of AI supercomputing to maintain training times of several weeks or less"".

According to the plan, China aims to build out more data centres across the country to facilitate businesses' access to computing power.

In order to meet the demands of the rapidly developing AI industry, Beijing also plans to improve computational infrastructure in western China.

Expansive but less populated provinces in China such as southwestern Guizhou have long been tasked to establish massive data centres to power the country’s internet. For example, Apple (NASDAQ: ) has set up data centres in Guizhou with a local partner to serve its users in the country.

Another focus is to improve the speed and efficiency of the computation network. The plan said that transmission speeds between critical computing facilities must not allow a latency of more than 5 milliseconds.

On Tuesday, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).'s stocks ended a four-day winning streak, declining by 0.34% despite a favorable market environment where both the and saw gains. This drop leaves Apple's shares at $19.84 below their 52-week high from July 2023.

Other tech giants were not immune to this downward trend. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ).'s shares fell by 0.43%, while Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s Class C and Class A shares also experienced drops of 0.22% and 0.26% respectively on the same day.

Interestingly, Apple's trading volume remained under its typical 50-day average, indicating less trading activity for the tech giant's stocks than usual. This occurred even as broader markets were on the rise, suggesting that investors may be exercising caution with respect to Apple's shares despite overall market optimism.

The downturn in these tech stocks comes amidst a generally positive market, with both the NASDAQ Composite Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average experiencing upward movements. However, it appears that even in a rising market, certain sectors or companies can experience declines, demonstrating the complex and multifaceted nature of stock market movements.

While this decline marks the end of a four-day winning streak for Apple, it remains to be seen how the company's stock will perform in the coming days and weeks ahead. With tech stocks showing some volatility despite broader market gains, investors will likely be keeping a close eye on these developments.

In the wake of escalating operational risks and retaliatory measures from China, G7 nations, along with businesses such as Dell (NYSE: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), HP (NYSE: ), and Mattel (NASDAQ: ), have started shifting their supply chains from China to friend-shoring and nearshoring countries like India, Thailand, Vietnam, Mexico, and Canada. This significant shift has been observed on Wednesday.

The retaliatory measures from China have had a profound impact on companies such as Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ) and led to an iPhone ban, resulting in a sales decline for US brands since 2018. Notably, GM experienced a significant market share drop due to these developments.

De-risking efforts have inadvertently increased operational risks such as supply chain complexity and lack of transparency. Companies like South Korea’s SK Hynix and Boeing (NYSE: ) have been affected by these challenges. Boeing's 787 aircraft production has faced setbacks due to these complications.

To mitigate the potential fallouts of this shift, several measures have been put in place. Government support has been extended in the form of the $52.7 billion US Chips Act subsidies. International agreements like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and CPTPP have also been implemented to help navigate these changes.

Another significant factor influencing supply chain decisions is the US Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act. The legislation has further complicated the global supply chain landscape, adding another layer of consideration for companies as they make strategic decisions about their operations.

(Reuters) -As big U.S. corporations kicked off corporate earnings season this week, executives addressed the Israel-Hamas conflict and some companies launched fundraising efforts.

""I just want to say how deeply saddened that we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel ... Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world,"" JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) CEO Jamie Dimon said on a post-earnings call before diving into results.

He warned that the war in Ukraine, compounded by the attacks on Israel, could have ""far-reaching impacts on energy and food markets, global trade, and geopolitical relationships.""

On Thursday, Pfizer (NYSE: ) CEO Albert Bourla said: ""As the days have passed, the scope of the atrocities carried out against Israel and its citizens have become clearer and more horrific. It is not enough to condemn terrorism and the intentional targeting of civilians - we ourselves must take action.""

Fundraising efforts to relieve the crisis have been mobilized swiftly. Billionaires and members of the U.S. and Canadian Jewish community have contributed millions of dollars, military gear and clothing, and food and household supplies.

On Thursday, in a memo to employees, UBS said it would match $5 million in donations from employees and clients and would work to expand its network of partners to provide aid with resettlement for displaced families.

Jefferies raised $13 million from clients, partners, and employees for charities providing humanitarian aid, it said on Friday. The contributions included $2 million from Michael Bloomberg, former New York City mayor and co-founder of Bloomberg LP.

Goldman Sachs pledged $2 million in aid and said it would match employee donations.

Delta Air Lines (NYSE: ), which has suspended flights to and from Israel until the end of this month, said it will donate $1 million to the American Red Cross.

On Friday, Citigroup (NYSE: ) CEO Jane Fraser included Israel in her opening remarks on the bank's earnings call.

""We are a significant bank in the country, and many of our people have lost friends and loved ones,"" Fraser said. ""Others are being called up to serve. Despite all they're dealing with, they are keeping our bank running in the country. And I'm, frankly, in awe of their commitment.""

More broadly, Fraser said, ""the price innocent civilians are paying as this crisis unfolds is absolutely devastating to witness.""

BlackRock (NYSE: ) CEO Larry Fink also addressed Israel on the company's earnings call.

""There's pretty much universal condemnation of violence with civilian casualties,"" said David Kotok, co-founder of Florida-based investment advisor Cumberland Advisors.

He noted that firms have refrained from mentioning specifics, given the political sensitivities of the conflict. ""Once someone ventures into the space of, 'who is the perpetrator and who is the victim,' you enter into the exposure of social media disinformation and risk,"" Kotok said.

Bosses at large tech companies have also issued strong statements.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: ) CEO Antonio Neri said: ""The attack by Hamas on Israeli civilians is unjustified and inexcusable"" and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) CEO Andy Jassy called the attacks ""shocking and painful to watch.""

Amazon said it has a contingency plan to keep its AWS cloud service available for customers in Israel. Meta (NASDAQ: ) said on Friday it was taking steps including removing praise and substantive support for Hamas from its platforms after the European Union reprimanded social media companies for failing to adequately tackle disinformation.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) CEO Sundar Pichai said it was ""important to call out and stand against antisemitism at this terrible moment"" and condemned ""this historic evil."" Google has two offices and over 2,000 employees in Israel.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) CEO Satya Nadella posted on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that he was ""heartbroken by the horrific terrorist attacks on Israel,"" where the company has nearly 3,000 employees.

Some large companies including Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ) had yet to issue statements, while some prominent personalities including NBA star LeBron James have spoken out.

Supermodel Gigi Hadid, whose father is Palestinian, said on Instagram: ""While I have hopes and dreams for Palestinians, none of them include the harm of a Jewish person.""",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-banks-tech-firms-offer-support-for-israel-victims-announce-aid-3198704,0.131,0.806,0.063,-0.9969

Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., the globally recognized iPhone producer, is set to announce its fiscal fourth quarter results on November 3. This comes in the wake of a 9% decrease in the company's stock value since August 1, stirring deliberations among investors about the optimal timing for investment. Apple's strong financial standing and potential for expansion suggest that it could be an opportune moment for purchasing shares.

The tech giant's market cap currently stands at nearly $2.8 trillion, a figure confirmed by InvestingPro's real-time metrics. This colossal valuation is backed by over 2 billion active devices, including iPhones. It generates more than $100 billion in annual free cash flow and ended its recent quarter with a net cash position of $57 billion after debt. This strong financial position enabled Apple to return more than $24 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the last quarter alone.

InvestingPro Tips reveal that Apple's management has been aggressively buying back shares, which is a strong vote of confidence in the company's future. Additionally, the company yields a high return on invested capital, which, combined with strong earnings, allows management to continue dividend payments. In fact, Apple has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, further demonstrating its financial health.

Even though a foreign-exchange headwind led to a 1% year-over-year revenue drop in fiscal Q3, there are promising areas for growth. The services segment, which includes AppleCare, App Store transactions and subscriptions, Apple Pay, and Apple TV+, recorded an 8% YoY growth in the same quarter. Additionally, Apple achieved record revenue in emerging markets like India, indicating potential for further expansion.

With these factors in mind, the company's current valuation of less than 30 times earnings is seen as reasonable ahead of its fiscal Q4 results announcement. InvestingPro's real-time metrics show a P/E Ratio of 29.72, reinforcing this viewpoint. The recent slump in Apple's stock price presents a unique opportunity for investors to acquire shares at a lower cost.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Vice Premier Ding Duexiang told Apple (NASDAQ: ) CEO Tim Cook the group was welcome to participate in developing China's digital economy, as Cook made a surprise visit to Beijing less than a month after the Chinese launch of its iPhone 15.

Cook's visit comes as competition between the U.S. tech giant and China's Huawei heats up in Apple's third-largest market, and as Beijing tightens oversight on security concerns.

Sales of iPhone 15 models in their first 17 days in China were down 4.5% compared to the iPhone 14, Counterpoint Research said, without providing specific figures.

China in September widened curbs on the use of iPhones by state employees, telling staff at some central government agencies to stop using their Apple handsets at work.

""China is willing to provide more opportunities for foreign-funded enterprises including Apple to develop in the country,"" Ding told Cook in a meeting on Thursday, according to Chinese state radio.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn, the largest supplier of Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhones, is the subject of tax audits in China at some of its key subsidiaries, suspected of violating laws and regulations, Chinese state media reported on Sunday.

China's natural resources department also conducted on-site investigations on the land use of Foxconn enterprises in Henan and Hubei provinces and elsewhere, the nationalist tabloid the Global Times reported. It did not elaborate on the investigations or the timing of them.

""Legal compliance everywhere we operate around the world is a fundamental principle of Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn),"" the company said in a statement, without addressing the allegations. ""We will actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations.""

Zhang Wensheng, deputy dean of the Taiwan Research Institute of Xiamen University, told the Global Times the audit and land use investigations was a normal procedure that would apply to any enterprise suspected of violating laws and regulations.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). is reportedly ramping up its efforts in generative artificial intelligence (AI), planning a $1 billion investment to integrate AI tools into Siri, Apple Music, and other applications. The tech giant's move is aimed at competing with Google (NASDAQ: )'s Bard AI bot and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, according to Bloomberg.

The company has posted several job openings focused on AI, indicating its intent to develop a generative AI-based developer experience platform for internal use and support the app development team. One particular opening in the Apple Retail department is geared towards developing a conversational AI platform for customer engagement.

Apple is also exploring ways to incorporate generative AI into development tools such as Xcode, presentation software Keynote, and apps like Pages for creating auto-generated playlists. These efforts are part of the company's larger initiative to infuse AI into its product suite and services.

In addition to these developments, Apple has built Ajax, a language model, and Apple GPT, a chatbot. These tools are awaiting integration into Siri, Messages, Xcode for aiding developers, and Apple Music for auto-playlists.

According to InvestingPro, Apple's management has been aggressively buying back shares, which is often seen as a sign of confidence in the company's future prospects. The tech giant also yields a high return on invested capital, and its strong earnings should allow the management to continue dividend payments. Moreover, Apple has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, which is a testament to its financial stability and commitment to rewarding shareholders. InvestingPro Tips also suggest that Apple operates with a high return on assets, which is an indication of the company's efficiency in using its resources.

Even with these advancements, compared to Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s investment in OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google's Bard AI bot, Apple's public AI initiatives are still considered lagging. Its only notable AI achievement so far has been an enhanced auto-correct feature in iOS 17.

The market has reacted moderately optimistically to Apple's AI push. The firm's shares have surged by nearly 37% in 2023. Analysts have given Apple's stock 20 Buys and nine Holds, with an average price target of $207.51, suggesting a 20.2% upside potential. InvestingPro data shows that Apple's market cap is $2710.0B USD, with a P/E ratio of 28.88 and a PEG ratio of -19.75, which investors may want to consider when evaluating the company's valuation.

When queried by Seeking Alpha about these developments, Apple chose not to comment. However, with a revenue of $383.93B USD and an operating income of $112.23B USD as per InvestingPro data, Apple's financial health appears to be strong, which could support its ambitious AI initiatives.

By Jamie McGeever

(Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever, financial markets columnist.

Good news was good news on Tuesday, as another surprisingly strong snapshot of U.S. business activity boosted investor sentiment and risk appetite, which should pave the way for a positive open in Asian markets on Wednesday.

Upbeat U.S. economic data often fuels Fed rate hike expectations, dragging stocks and other asset markets lower. But not this time - investors cheered the unexpected expansion in manufacturing and service sector activity, and the gloom that has descended on markets recently lifted.

Asian markets should follow suit, as there's not much locally for traders to get their teeth into - Australian consumer inflation for September and the third quarter are the only numbers likely to have any meaningful market impact.

The three main U.S. indexes closed up between 0.6% and 0.9%, and U.S. tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) posted forecast-beating earnings after the bell.

Investors' immediate reaction, however, was mixed. Alphabet's cloud-based revenue fell short of analysts' expectations, pushing shares down more than 5% in after-hours trade, while Microsoft shares rose 4% after hours.

In Asia on Wednesday, South Korea's LG Display (NYSE: ) is expected to show a fall in quarterly revenue when it reports results. The Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier has posted losses for the last five quarters but is eyeing a turnaround in the final quarter of the year.

On the economic data front, annual consumer inflation in Australia is expected to slow to 5.3% in the third quarter from 6.0% in the April-June period.

But on a monthly basis, it is expected to rise to 5.4% in September from 5.2% in August, which would mark the first time this year that inflation has risen two months in succession.

Reserve Bank of Australia governor Michele Bullock on Tuesday warned there were risks inflation would prove more stubborn than expected and that interest rates might have to rise further to bring it to heel.

The Australian dollar liked what it heard, bucked the global trend of widespread weakness against the U.S. dollar, and goes into the inflation data on the front foot around $0.6360.

Chinese assets remain under pressure, even though the blue chip CSI300 index snapped a four-day losing streak and rebounded from Monday's four and a half year low.

Meanwhile, there is a slew of China-related policy and political news for investors to digest.

China's top parliament body has approved a 1 trillion yuan sovereign bond issue and Beijing has appointed Lan Foan, a technocrat with little central government experience, as the new finance minister.

Chinese President Xi Jinping made his first known visit to the nation's central bank since he became president a decade ago, also seen by some as reflection of the government's focus on supporting the economy.

Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Wednesday:

- Australia CPI inflation (September/Q3)

- South Korea consumer sentiment (October)

- South Korea LG earnings (Q3)

Recently, streaming giants Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Disney too had raised their prices as they look to boost growth amid intense competition.

Netflix increased subscription prices for some streaming plans in the United States, Britain and France when it reported results last week.

Masimo (MASI) today announced that the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) has recommended a limited exclusion order for infringing Apple Watches with light-based pulse oximetry functionality. The USITC found that Apple (AAPL) violated U.S. laws by incorporating Masimo’s patented light-based pulse oximetry technology in its products. The exclusion is scheduled to go into effect after a 60-day Presidential review period.

“Today’s ruling by the USITC sends a powerful message that even the world’s largest company is not above the law,” said Joe Kiani, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Masimo. “This important determination is a strong validation of our efforts to hold Apple accountable for unlawfully misappropriating our patented technology,” added Mr. Kiani.

Comments from two dozen academic institutions, leading antitrust and intellectual property scholars, physicians, investors, nonprofits, and members of Congress were filed in support of the public’s interest in the exclusion order. These comments conveyed a similar message: to protect innovation, such as Masimo’s technology, and to protect public health, it is necessary to preserve incentives to innovate and protect intellectual property and fair competition.

In its comment submitted to the ITC, the Consumer Federation of America stated, “There is no greater offense to both the antitrust and intellectual property law than when a dominant firm infringes the patent of a smaller rival, who is an actual or potential competitor. In this case, as in the other cases involving Apple’s egregious abuse of market power, the harms far outweigh the benefit. In fact, because competition will swiftly replace any services or products that Apple is no longer able to deliver because of the remedy, there will be little harm and a great deal of benefit for consumers and the economy.”",https://www.investing.com/news/assorted/masimo-announces-usitc-issued-exclusion-order-for-infringing-apple-watches-finds-apple-violated-trade-laws-432SI-3211111,0.093,0.736,0.171,0.9799

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's trade-dependent economy likely grew faster in the third quarter than the second thanks to resilient domestic consumption and a tentative rebound in exports, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.

Gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to have expanded 2.1% in the July-September period versus a year earlier, the poll of 20 economists showed. GDP grew 1.36% year-on-year in the second quarter, having slipped into recession in the first.

The economists' forecasts for preliminary GDP data due on Tuesday varied widely from an expansion of just 0.5% to as much as 3.75%.

Taiwan's exports emerged from a year-long decline in September, rising for the first time in 13 months on increased demand from the United States ahead of the year-end holiday shopping season.

Third quarter exports dropped 5.1% compared with the same period in 2022, a marked improvement on the second quarter's annual contraction of 16.9%.

Kevin Wang, an economist at Taishin Securities Investment Advisory in Taipei, said although external demand for made-in-Taiwan goods was picking up, the momentum was not strong.

""Private consumption was the bright spot in the third quarter, owing to the contribution of the peak summer vacation season,"" he added.

The government's statistics bureau said in August it expects full-year 2023 growth of 1.61%, its slowest pace in eight years and lower than the 2.45% growth for 2022.

The economy in China, Taiwan's largest export market, grew at a faster-than-expected clip in the third quarter, expanding 4.9% from the year earlier.

Taiwan is a key hub in the global technology supply chain for giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), and home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC).

Taiwan's preliminary GDP figures will be released in a statement with minimal commentary. Revised figures will be released a few weeks later, with more details and forward-looking forecasts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors are watching for signs that the conflict in the Middle East may be escalate over the weekend, potentially ratcheting up volatility as investors await a Federal Reserve meeting and key U.S. data in the week ahead.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that Israeli forces had unleashed the second phase of the Gaza war as they pressed ground operations against Hamas militants.

Investors have grown more worried about a widening conflict in recent days after the U.S. dispatched more military assets to the Middle East while Israel attacked targets in Gaza and Hamas supporters in Lebanon and Syria.

""The situation in Israel is … causing a lot of anxiety,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab (NYSE: ).

On Friday, futures settled up 2.9% at $90.48 a barrel on concerns the conflict could disrupt crude supplies. , a popular safe haven for nervous investors, vaulted over $2,000 for the first time since mid-May.

In a note on Friday, analysts at Capital Economics said the oil market's response to the conflict was ""muted"" so far.

""That said, any sign that the other countries in the region are becoming more involved in the conflict would cause oil prices to rise sharply,"" they wrote.

If an escalation of the conflict causes the U.S. to increase war-related spending that raises the deficit, Treasury yields could rise beyond the 16-year highs they already have hit, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities.

Some investors also expect a widening conflict could prompt safe-haven buying of Treasuries. This could moderate the surge in yields, which move inversely to prices, and this in turn could ease pressure on stocks and other assets.

The has fallen more than 10% since late July, when it reached its high for 2023, though the index is up over 7% year-to-date.

""So far, U.S. government bonds have not been performing their usual safe-haven function,"" UBS Global Wealth Management said in a note on Friday. ""However, an escalation of the conflict would likely shift attention away from monetary policy concerns and boost safe-haven demand for Treasuries.""

Both gold and oil can also provide hedges against near-term volatility, they said.

The Cboe Volatility index has climbed in the wake of the conflict and rose on Friday, approaching seven-month highs.

Corvex doubles stake in Southwest Gas, seeks possible sale of utility business

Corvex Management LP, a hedge fund, more than doubled its stake in Southwest Gas (NYSE: ), disclosed at the end of the June quarter - to 4,153,717 shares, or 5.8% of the company.

Corvex says it aims to discuss potential strategies to maximize the company's value with the board, particularly its core utility franchises and Centuri Group investment. Corvex says that, while it supports Southwest's plan to separate Centuri, it believes Southwest Gas seems to be trading at or below its currently authorized rate base. It says that the implied valuation represents a ""deep discount to underlying value, market comps, and recent transactions"" and suggested the company may need to address this if that disconnect persists. Corvex added that ""similar assets trade at a 1.5-2.0x rate base.""

Corvex also believes Southwest’s ambitious $2 billion capital plan ""clearly does not make sense if growth capital results in a market valuation less than cost.""

The hedge fund said it expects to engage with Southwest on ways to enhance shareholder value, including by improving earned returns on capital, further restructuring, or an outright sale of the company.

Ancora supports Forward Air’s decision to seek termination of the Omni Logistics merger

Ancora Holdings Group, a leading shareholder of Forward Air Corporation (NASDAQ: ), backed Forward Air's recently disclosed position that Omni Logistics has violated the terms of their merger agreement, first announced in mid-August.

“In light of this, we – and presumably a critical mass of our fellow shareholders – fully support leadership’s decision to explore a termination of the merger agreement,” said Ancora.

The stock took a huge hit after the merger's August announcement, with Ancora and other key shareholders opposing the deal and three former Forward Air executives and current shareholders filing a lawsuit to block the deal last month.

Despite a judge dissolving a restraining order related to the merger, Forward Air accuses Omni of not meeting certain obligations in the merger agreement, and said it will not be obligated to close.

Satori's Dan Niles covers shorts in Tesla and Apple and looks to re-short higher

Satori Fund’s Dan Niles stated on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that he has covered his short positions in Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) but is eyeing opportunities to re-short at higher levels.

Tesla's stock has been slumping recently following worse-than-expected Q3 deliveries and earnings results. In October alone, Tesla shares slid nearly 20%, hitting their lowest level in five months this past Thursday.

Apple has also been moving lower, although not in as strong a downtrend as Tesla.

A trio of insider buys

Truist Financial (NYSE: ) CEO, William Rogers (NYSE: ), purchased 10,000 common shares, or worth around $280,000, at an average price of $28.048 per share.

Nasdaq (NASDAQ: ) Director, Johan Torgeby, purchased 14,000 common shares, or worth more than $700,000, at $50.42.

Commercial Metals (NYSE: ) President and CEO, Peter Matt, purchased 6,200 common shares, or worth nearly $250,000, at $40.30.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rallied on Monday, kicking off what promises to be a hectic week that includes a heavy earnings docket, economic data and the Federal Reserve's two-day monetary policy meeting.

All three major U.S. stock indexes closed up more than 1%, bouncing back from the previous week's sell-off. Interest rate sensitive megacap stocks, led by Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) provided the most upside muscle.

""Today is an earnings rebound,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, in New York. ""The market got oversold, and the reality is that earnings have been pretty good, the U.S. economy continues to chug along, and is likely to do so in the fourth quarter and into the first part of next year.""

Third-quarter earnings season, firing on all cylinders, has reached its halfway point, with 251 of the companies in the having reported. Of those, 78% have beaten Wall Street estimates, according to LSEG.

Analysts now expect, on aggregate, annual third quarter S&P 500 earnings growth of 4.3%, a marked improvement over the 1.6% year-on-year growth seen at the beginning of October.

Investors have shown “less pessimism,"" Pursche added. ""First- and second-quarter calls had a more negative tone. There was anxiety over interest rates, Fed policy, the recession that never came.""

In the coming week, Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: ), Apple Inc, Pfizer Inc (NYSE: ) and Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ: ) are among the higher profile companies expected to post results.

On Tuesday, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) is expected to convene for a two-day monetary policy meeting, which is expected to culminate in a decision to let the Fed funds target rate stand at 5.25%-5.50%.

Investors will scrutinize the accompanying statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's subsequent Q&A session for clues regarding the central bank's path forward with rates.

""The Fed wants to see the cumulative effects of their rate hikes on the economy but they’ve also said they’re prepared to over-shoot in an abundance of caution, as long as inflation is above 3%,"" Pursche said.

The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan would also be announcing rate decisions this week, with the latter set to consider a further adjustment to its yield curve control (YCC) framework, according to a report.

Closely watched economic data is on tap this week, culminating in the U.S. Labor Department's October employment report due on Friday.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch consumer watchdog is challenging the fees that Apple (NASDAQ: ) charges dating app providers in the Netherlands as part of its long-running case against the U.S. technology company over the dominance of its app store, according to a filing seen by Reuters.

Bloomberg News reported on the filing earlier on Tuesday.

Although the case is limited to dating apps in the Netherlands, it is seen as having potential to set a precedent for other markets.

The Netherlands' Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) in 2021 fined the company 50 million euros ($53 million) for failure to comply with changes it had ordered to Apple's app store to end practices it said violated European Union antitrust laws.

Apple denied wrongdoing and appealed the fines in a case still before a Rotterdam Court. Apple did agreed to make changes to the app store including opening it to alternative forms of payment for dating apps in the Netherlands.

In February 2022 Apple cut commissions for dating app makers in the Netherlands to 27% from 30%. The ACM never disclosed whether it believed that was a satisfactory change.

This month, the ACM published a summary of its rebuttals to Apple objections dated July 13, 2023, noting there was one remaining dispute it could not disclose publicly for legal reasons.

According to the ACM's fuller July 13 arguments now seen by Reuters, the undisclosed dispute was over commissions.

""Apple ... harms dating app providers by charging them an additional, and inexplicably higher, fee for the same services"" it does other types of app makers, it said in the document.

A spokeswoman for the ACM said on Tuesday the agency cannot comment while the case is before the court. No decision date has been set.

(Reuters) - Walt Disney (NYSE: )'s ESPN sports network could secure an enterprise value of $24 billion and attract investment interest from sports leagues, tech firms like Apple (NASDAQ: ) and telecom majors including Verizon (NYSE: ), according to BofA Global Research.

In a bid to lure an outside investor, the media giant last month disclosed the financials of ESPN that revealed declining sales and profit at the network considered to be the crown jewel of its traditional TV business.

CEO Bob Iger has said Disney wants to keep ESPN and will try to create a streaming app for it by either forming a joint venture or finding a buyer for a minority stake in the network.

That means a 36% interest in ESPN would be up for sale, assuming Disney intends to retain a 51% majority interest and accounting for media company Hearst's 20% stake, BofA analysts led by Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote in a note published Wednesday.

Interested parties could include leagues like the National Football League and the National Basketball Association, newcomers like Apple and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), which are jostling to get into live sports, and distributors like Verizon and Comcast (NASDAQ: ), the note said.

Disney would gain a lot from the deal as more capital would mean ESPN would be able to strengthen its offerings, keep the option of a spin-off open and help the network focus on high-growth streaming, the brokerage said.

Rising cord-cutting has hit the linear television business, and acquiring sports rights has become an increasingly expensive affair, with future sports rights expected to be north of $69 billion.

Benefits to prospective buyers, however, appear ""nebulous"", BofA said.

""ESPN is still a strong business and a premier brand, but it sits at the nexus of possible major business transformation. Transitions have historically proven difficult and typically not conducive to significant growth,"" it added.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/disneys-espn-could-be-valued-at-24-billion-likely-buyers-include-apple-verizon--bofa-3217630,0.014,0.887,0.099,0.9618

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks jumped on Friday after a cooler than expected job report for October stoked hopes that the Federal Reserve could be done with interest rate increases.

Here are some of the biggest U.S. stock movers today:

Apple (NASDAQ: ) stock fell 0.8% after the iPhone maker predicted quarterly sales that were below market estimates, blaming weak demand for iPads and wearables, especially in key market China.

Restaurant Brands (NYSE: ) stock fell 1.8% after the company beat third-quarter earnings views even as it missed expectations for quarterly sales on Friday, as still-high inflation pressured consumer spending at its Burger King chain.

Block (NYSE: ) stock soared 12% after the payments firm reported better-than-expected earnings forecast for 2024 and a $1 billion stock buyback plan.

DraftKings (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 14% after the sports betting company beat expectations for quarterly as it rises to the top of the highly competitive online gambling industry.

Sempra Energy (NYSE: ) stock rose 1.3% after the power and gas utility posted better-than-expected third-quarter profit but revenue that fell short of estimates.

The FAANG stocks, which include Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ), and Netflix (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ), have demonstrated significant growth in 2023. Among them, Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, has been the standout performer with its shares soaring more than 155%. This substantial increase is largely attributed to strong quarterly updates.

Despite potential distortions in earnings, Meta is projected to maintain its growth trajectory. The company's lower price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, a metric that takes into account future growth estimates, signals a promising future. The tech giant is expected to bolster its growth by monetizing high-growth areas such as Reels and AI-powered business messaging.

Meanwhile, other FAANG stocks are also set for continued growth. Increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to favor Amazon and Alphabet as organizations increasingly utilize their cloud platforms. Apple's investment in generative AI and potential profits from the self-driving car market could further enhance its performance.

Netflix, on the other hand, is banking on its ad-supported streaming model and gaming for future growth. While all FAANG stocks have performed impressively this year, with Apple recording nearly a 40% increase in year-to-date returns despite being the least performer among them, Meta seems poised to lead in the next decade. However, it's clear that other FAANG stocks also hold strong potential for sustained growth.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and a major Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier, on Sunday stuck to its previous outlook of strong year-end holiday sales, and said customers were buying well in China and the United States.

The fourth quarter is traditionally the hot season for Taiwan's tech companies as they race to supply smartphones, tablets and other electronics to major vendors such as Apple for the year-end holiday period in Western markets.

Foxconn said in a statement that with the second half of the year a ""traditional peak season"" for consumer tech products, operations ""will ramp up sequentially"", sticking to its outlook given last month.

""Significant growth outlook in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter remains unchanged,"" it added, without elaborating.

Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said revenue last month reached T$741.2 billion ($23.09 billion), the second highest ever for October, down 4.56% year-on-year, coming off a high base, and up 12.2% from September.

Revenue in its smart consumer electronics products, including smartphones, saw ""significant"" growth month-on-month as new products drove demand and ahead of China's Singles Day shopping event this month and Thanksgiving holidays in the United States, Foxconn said.

The company is the Apple's biggest iPhone assembler.

Apple, which in September launched a new series of iPhones, on Thursday gave a sales forecast for the holiday quarter that missed Wall Street expectations, hurt by weak demand for iPads and wearables.

Foxconn releases third-quarter earnings on Nov. 14, when it will give more details on its outlook.

Foxconn's Taipei-listed shares closed down 1.2% on Friday ahead of the release of its October sales, compared with a 0.7% gain for the broader market. Foxconn shares have dropped 4% this year, giving it a market value of $41.5 billion.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) reported a challenging third quarter, marked by a $23.5 billion investment loss, largely due to declining stakes in Apple (NASDAQ: ), American Express (NYSE: ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), and Bank of America. The strategic sale of over 12 million Chevron (NYSE: ) shares ahead of its Hess (NYSE: ) acquisition further affected the portfolio value, causing it to drop from $353 billion to $319 billion.

Despite these setbacks, the conglomerate managed to report a 40.6% surge in Q3 operating earnings to $10.761 billion. This was driven by rising interest rates that benefited its insurance businesses like Geico and BNSF Railway. These businesses generated $1.7 billion in interest income, which helped boost operating income to nearly $11 billion.

The company also reported an unprecedented cash reserve of $157.2 billion, propelled by Buffett's strategy of acquiring high-yield short-term Treasury bills and amassing holdings of $126.4 billion. Charlie Munger hinted at a potential major acquisition in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, which could be a strategic move utilizing this record cash reserve.

However, despite soaring share prices, the company's share buyback program slowed down, with just $1.1 billion spent in Q3. Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares appreciated nearly 14% this year but experienced a 6% slump from their September peak.

Among its portfolio companies, Geico reported strong underwriting earnings of $1.1 billion. In contrast, BNSF Railway faced a 15% profit drop due to dwindling freight volumes and escalating costs.

By Jamie McGeever

ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - As banks and asset managers prepare 2024 investment outlooks, the emerging consensus will be tempered by the fact so many were wrong-footed this year by the relentless rise in U.S. borrowing rates.

If investors failed to heed the 'don't fight the Fed' mantra this year, they should be doubly cautious about ignoring it again next year.

Of course, the economic expansion is another year older and the Federal Reserve is closer to the end of its rate-hiking campaign than it was 12 months ago. But betting against the Fed is risky, no matter where the economic or policy cycles are.

The recent rally in U.S. stocks and bonds looks likely to prompt another game of ""cat and mouse"" between the Fed and investors around a resulting loosening of financial conditions the central bank may or may not be happy with.

It's a game markets have consistently been losing for the past 18 months, and may make them wary of another bout.

Assuming the slowing economy doesn't suddenly fall off a cliff, which is now unlikely in most economists' eyes, an inflation rate still well above 2% targets forces Fed officials to restate the view that rate cuts are off the agenda.

In that light, the 75 basis points of easing traders now expect next year appears somewhat optimistic. And if so, the current whoosh of optimism lifting asset prices and investor sentiment is probably misplaced also.

""It's a fragile narrative the market is holding onto right now,"" notes Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management.

John Porter, chief investment officer for equities at Newton Investment Management agrees. ""Higher rates and higher inflation still pose headwinds for capital markets next year.""

WARNING SHOT

A quick comparison between some key market metrics and projections today versus the end of last year is instructive, bearing in mind how markets have performed so far in 2023.

At the end of 2022, annual PCE inflation was 5.4%, the fed funds policy target range was 4.25%-4.50%, rates futures were pricing in around 30 basis points of tightening over the next 12 months, the S&P 500 12-month forward price/earnings ratio was 17, and the 12-month earnings per share growth forecast was 4%.

So far this year the Fed has raised the policy rate by 100 basis points to a 5.25%-5.50% range, rates futures are now pricing in 75 bps of rate cuts in 2024, S&P 500 earnings growth this year is around 2.5%, and next year's growth is projected at around 11%.

All in all, that might be a fairly optimistic picture, which is why the ebb and flow of financial conditions will be watched so closely.

Last month, with yields on their way to 16-year highs and Wall Street entering correction territory, nearly every Fed official specifically mentioned or alluded to tighter financial conditions cooling the economy rather than further rate hikes.

The sharp reversal now underway will be concerning - Goldman Sachs's financial conditions index fell 50 bps in the week of Oct. 27-Nov. 3, one of the biggest declines in 20 years.

Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan on Tuesday fired what could be seen as a warning shot, saying the recent loosening meant the Fed's fight against inflation may not yet be won.

For markets, there may be enough in the tank to keep the rally going for the rest of this year on overshooting momentum. But if the underlying fundamentals don't match up, it won't last.

""We see a year-end rally coming into play, and if the Fed cuts rates next year, equity markets will do ok,"" said Colin Graham, head of multi-asset strategies at Robeco. ""But that's not our central view - rate expectations for next year are far too dovish.""

Graham is cautious on U.S. stocks. Apart from the 'Magnificent Seven' mega-tech stocks like Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), which comprise around 28% of the S&P 500's market cap, the earnings and performance picture has been less encouraging.

So far this year, these seven firms have accounted for almost 70% of the index's 14% gains, only around a quarter of all stocks have outperformed the broader market, and the equal-weighted 's underperformance relative to the cap-weighted index is one of the biggest in years.

All that may suggest the market is an attractive bet going into next year, a fair assumption if interest rates, bond yields and credit conditions are easing. Less so if the Fed is minded to stay 'higher for longer'.

ExxonMobil (NYSE: ) has overtaken Tesla (NASDAQ: ) as the most shorted large-cap stock in the in October, according to data from HazelTree. This development ends Tesla's four-month reign in the top position. The list of the three most shorted stocks in the large-cap sector now includes ExxonMobil, Tesla, and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

HazelTree uses a ""Crowdedness Score"" from 1 to 99 to rank these short bets. ExxonMobil and Tesla scored 99 and 97, respectively, while other high scorers included Apple (94), Charter Communications (NASDAQ: ) (91), and Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) (91). In the mid-cap sector, SOFI Technologies led with a score of 99, followed by American Airlines (NASDAQ: ) and EV maker Lucid (NASDAQ: ) both at 92.

The firm also monitors the percentage of a stock's institutional supply that is loaned to short sellers. Rivian (NASDAQ: ) Automotive led this category with 37%, significantly more than ExxonMobil's 3.13% and Tesla's 2.67%.

Despite facing challenges such as uncertain demand for electric vehicles and stiff competition leading to price cuts on its vehicles this year, Tesla has seen a significant increase of 76% in its share price year-to-date. On the other hand, ExxonMobil has experienced a decline of about 6% over the same period.

Other stocks that saw considerable short interest included Rivian, SNAP, Ford (NYSE: ), and AirBnB (NASDAQ: ).

As part of a broader strategic retreat from its consumer banking foray, Goldman Sachs Bank has announced plans to transfer its GM and Apple (NASDAQ: ) credit card services to another lender. This move comes in the wake of the bank divesting from several retail banking operations, signaling a shift back to its core strengths.

The decision to offload the GM credit card business, which Goldman Sachs acquired from Capital One for $2.5 billion in October 2020, aligns with its current approach to streamline operations. The bank's Platform Solutions division, responsible for the GM credit card program offering rewards for vehicle owners, is actively seeking a new issuer for this service.

In addition to the GM credit card, Goldman Sachs is also considering a sale of its Apple credit card scheme, which was launched in 2019. CEO David Solomon has underscored the importance of focusing on the company's central franchises during a period marked by a contraction in their consumer business segment.

The transition of these credit card services is part of a larger trend at Goldman Sachs, following the sale of their personal loan business that was integrated via the acquisition of GreenSky in 2022. While American Express (NYSE: ) has been mentioned as a potential suitor for the credit card portfolios, the future ownership of these services is yet to be confirmed.

Goldman Sachs' pivot away from consumer lending has been attributed to high costs stemming from its unsuccessful expansion efforts in this area. The Wall Street Journal reported Today that this strategic realignment is an acknowledgment of the challenges faced by the bank in competing within the consumer finance market.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The multi-billion dollar payments that Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google makes to Apple (NASDAQ: ), wireless carriers and others are normal competitive behavior and not an abuse of monopoly, an expert called by Google testified on Monday in a blockbuster antitrust trial.

In what is expected to be the last week of trial, Kevin Murphy, who teaches at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, argued Apple and others played Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), which has the Bing search engine, off against each other in order to win big payments from Google.

The government, which has filed four major antitrust lawsuits against three Big Tech companies since 2020, has accused Google of paying billions - $26.3 billion in 2021 - to ensure that its search is the default on smartphones and browsers and to keep its market share in the stratosphere. It alleges the payments are an abuse of monopoly.

""The payments that Google makes reflect that competition,"" he said.

Murphy also argued that the payments to device makers and others were often passed through to users in the form of a cheaper phone or better data plan.

Further, Murphy argued that while Microsoft had virtually all the preinstalled browser defaults in early 2010s, its Bing search engine got just 15% of search queries.

He said that there was ""some truth"" to the argument that changing defaults on devices might be complex for some but those same people often get around that difficulty by switching to a different browser or another workaround.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/googles-expert-in-us-antitrust-trial-defends-billions-paid-to-device-makers-3232828,0.039,0.892,0.069,0.7946

The once-symbiotic relationship known as ""Chimerica,"" which highlighted the deep economic interdependence between the United States and China, is undergoing significant stress amid escalating political tensions. The term, coined by historian Niall Ferguson, described a period when the US leveraged China's low-cost manufacturing capabilities while China invested heavily in US government bonds, thus lowering American borrowing costs. This dynamic has been disrupted by a series of steep tariffs and export restrictions resulting from a trade war.

Despite these geopolitical strains, the two global powers remain deeply interconnected. Tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ) continues to produce the majority of its iPhones in China, and Chinese firms are dominant in the solar energy panel market. Moreover, China remains a crucial market for many international brands. The complexity of these commercial ties is expected to be a key topic during the upcoming meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Biden.

As political rifts drive changes in global supply chains, companies are increasingly looking to diversify production. Nations such as Mexico and Central America are becoming more attractive for investments as businesses seek to reduce their reliance on Chinese manufacturing.

The origins of China's trade-centric focus can be traced back to Deng Xiaoping's reforms in the late 1970s. China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 was a pivotal moment that granted it broader access to global markets while it pledged to open its own market to foreign competition. Although this led to an influx of affordable goods benefiting US consumers and corporations, it also resulted in significant job losses within the United States, contributing to the economic discontent that partly propelled Donald J. Trump to the presidency in 2016.

The Biden administration has expressed intentions to lessen America's dependence on Chinese industry, seeking greater resilience and diminished vulnerability to disruptions. However, even as manufacturing shifts to other countries like Vietnam, these goods often still rely on parts and materials sourced from China.

The dissolution of this economic partnership poses challenges and opportunities for global trade as both nations navigate this evolving landscape.

(Reuters) - REI, the camping and outdoor sports equipment retailer, was accused on Wednesday of dozens of violations of U.S. labor law at eight retail stores that have unionized since last year.

Workers at stores in New York, California, Chicago and Boston, among others, filed a total of 80 complaints with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) seeking to force the company to bargain with their unions.

The complaints claim that REI has retaliated against pro-union workers, restructured jobs and changed working conditions without input from the unions, as well as stalled bargaining with unions that won elections at the stores.

The labor board investigates worker complaints before deciding whether to pursue formal cases against employers. Those charges are heard by administrative judges, whose decisions can be appealed to the five-member NLRB and then to federal appeals courts.

Sumner, Washington-based REI, also known by its full name Recreational Equipment Inc, said in a statement that it disagrees with the claims in the complaints.

""We are committed and engaged in good-faith bargaining with stores that have chosen union representation and will continue to participate fully in the negotiating process,"" the company said.

The company, which has about 180 stores and 15,000 employees nationwide, has said that recent changes to job titles and workers' schedules were unrelated to union organizing.

The union campaign at REI is part of a nationwide wave of labor organizing that began during the COVID-19 pandemic and has included Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) Inc baristas, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ) warehouse workers, employees of several video game makers, and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) retail workers, among others.

The unionized stores are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.

In statements provided by the unions, several REI employees said the company's actions have infringed on their rights to freely choose union representation.

""Instead of acknowledging our collective voice and our right to form a union, we faced strong opposition from management in the form of retaliation, misinformation, and disregard for basic labor law,"" said Anni Saludo, a sales specialist at an REI store in Durham, North Carolina.

The complaints come after employees at REI stores in Chicago, Boston and Minnesota staged walkouts last month to protest layoffs and changes to working conditions.",https://www.investing.com/news/economy/rei-accused-of-widespread-labor-law-violations-at-unionized-us-stores-3235500,0.071,0.884,0.045,-0.8402

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - TikTok on Thursday joined Meta in appealing against the ""gatekeeper"" status under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), an EU law that brings in tougher rules for tech companies and makes it easier for users to move between competing services.

Meta on Wednesday challenged the ""gatekeeper"" designations for its Messenger and Marketplace platforms, but did not appeal against the status for Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Instagram and WhatsApp.

The European Union in September picked 22 ""gatekeeper"" services, run by six tech companies - Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Meta and ByteDance's TikTok.

While Microsoft, Google and Amazon did not challenge their designations, Apple is yet to comment on its plan. Nov. 16 is the last date to appeal.

""Our appeal is based on the belief that our designation risks undermining the DMA's own stated goal by protecting actual gatekeepers from newer competitors like TikTok,"" it said.

""Far from being a gatekeeper, our platform, which has been operating in Europe for just over five years, is arguably the most capable challenger to more entrenched platform businesses.""

The video sharing app said it does not meet the law's threshold for revenues generated in the European Economic Area of 7.5 billion euros ($8.13 billion) per annum.

Under the DMA, companies with more than 45 million monthly active users and a market capitalisation of 75 billion euros are considered gatekeepers providing a core platform service.

The company said it was designated a gatekeeper based on its parent company, ByteDance's, global market capitalisation that us based primarily on the performance of business lines that do not even operate in Europe.

Last month, China's ByteDance bought back shares from U.S. employees in a deal that valued the company at $223.5 billion.

TikTok, which has over 134 million monthly users, said it is a challenger, not an incumbent, in digital advertising and no market investigation was conducted in relation to its designation by the European Commission.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -China is ready to be a partner and friend of the United States, and there is plenty of room for bilateral cooperation, President Xi Jinping told American executives in San Francisco on Wednesday, as Beijing looks to reassure global business and counter his country's struggles to entice foreign investment.

The U.S. executives dined with Xi on the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum following a day of talks between the Chinese leader and U.S. President Joe Biden, aimed at steadying relations between the world's two largest economies.

Xi received a standing ovation as he entered the room, and two more before and after he took the stage to speak.

The world needs China and the U.S. to work together, and it is wrong to view China as a threat and play a zero-sum game against it, Xi said in a speech to the audience, including some hand-picked by Beijing.

""Whatever stage of development it may reach, China will never pursue hegemony or expansion, and will never impose its will on others. China does not seek spheres of influence, and will not fight a cold war or a hot war with anyone,"" Xi said.

He assured his audience that ""no matter how the global landscape evolves, the historical trend of peaceful coexistence between China and the United States will not change.""

Xi's optimistic tone toward relations with the U.S. was at odds with the negative chorus of voices in Washington, where the U.S. Congress finds unusual bipartisan consensus in the need to counter Beijing.

The high-security dinner was a chance for companies to hear directly from China's leader as they search for ways to navigate China's economic slowdown, a U.S. push to ""de-risk"" some American supply chains away from China, and uncertainty caused by China's expanding security rules.

Executives from U.S. corporate giants such as Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Tim Cook, BlackRock (NYSE: )'s Laurence Fink, Broadcom (NASDAQ: )'s Hock Tan, Bridgewater Associates' Ray Dalio and Pfizer (NYSE: )'s Albert Bourla were at the dinner tables.

Xi also met Tesla (NASDAQ: ) CEO Elon Musk, telling him that he supports the company's development in China, according to a statement from the auto maker's Weibo (NASDAQ: ) Account on Thursday.

The dinner, where courses served included coffee-crusted black angus flat iron steak and a vegetable curry with squash and rice, attracted nearly 400 people, including government officials and academics.

But Xi directed much of his speech toward the American people and spent little time on commercial relations with the U.S.

""I would like to let you know that China sympathizes deeply with the American people, especially the young, for the sufferings that fentanyl has inflicted upon them,"" he said.

Biden and Xi earlier reached an agreement on working together to curb fentanyl production.

CONTROVERSY

U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other senior U.S. officials also attended the event, which generated controversy due to reported high ticket costs for companies seeking to brush shoulders with Xi.

Mike Gallagher, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives' select committee on China, had called it ""unconscionable"" that U.S. companies would pay thousands of dollars to join a dinner with a government the United States says is committing genocide against Muslim Uyghurs.

Gallagher sent a letter on Monday to the hosts – the U.S.-China Business Council and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations – demanding a complete list of individuals and companies that purchased tickets to the dinner. Analysts have said Xi's speech alone is unlikely to dramatically alter U.S. business sentiment about China. U.S. and Chinese officials have often described bilateral business and trade relations as the ballast in otherwise contentious ties with the U.S. But the growing economic and geopolitical rivalry between the superpowers has placed companies from both countries in the crosshairs of the other's government. China has grown more suspicious of engagement with Western companies, in line with Xi's emphasis on self-reliance and national security, and this year it has cracked down on some U.S. consultancy and due-diligence firms, further damaging investor confidence. But Gary Dvorchak, whose family hosted Xi in Iowa in 1985 as a young Chinese official, and who was invited by Beijing to attend the dinner, said Xi's appearance was savvy public relations, allowing the ruling Communist Party to show his appeal to regular people. ""It humanizes him and it gives him an ability to show a connection to the American people and bypass the American media,"" Dvorchak said.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/xi-tells-us-firms-china-ready-to-be-partner-and-friend-3235880,0.036,0.884,0.08,0.9836

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) has announced a delay in the release of its highly anticipated $3,499 Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, now expected to arrive in March due to complex design and manufacturing challenges, Bloomberg reported today. The tech giant had initially planned for a January launch.

The Vision Pro mixed-reality device, which merges virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) through a single optical glass lens, was first unveiled with an early next year sales target. The headset's unique design elements, constructed from glass, aluminum, and carbon fiber, have reportedly led to adjustments in production forecasts as early as July.

Despite these setbacks, Apple's stock saw a slight increase today following the news. The company is also adjusting its strategy for other products; plans to include Apple's own cellular modems in MacBooks are now delayed until at least 2028, moving away from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) chips.

The Vision Pro is designed to operate with an R1 chip that supports the M2 chip, processing inputs from twelve cameras, five sensors, and six microphones. It also features a two-hour power supply through an external battery connection.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) is considering the addition of a third plant in Kumamoto, Japan, which may produce cutting-edge 3-nanometer chips for major clients such as Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). This move aligns with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's robust drive for technological investments. However, the start dates for the plant remain unclear, with concerns that by the time it launches, newer technologies might surpass the planned advancements.

Japan's proactive approach to semiconductor manufacturing is further emphasized by Rapidus Corp.'s efforts to enter the sub-5nm chip market, a direct response to the delayed funding allocation from the U.S. Chips Act. TSMC's projected $20 billion investment in its Japan venture could be significantly reduced through Japanese government subsidies. The company is already moving forward with Sony (NYSE: ) Group Corp.-supported facilities expected to commence production of advanced chips by late 2024, with ambitions to initiate finer-scale production by 2025.

Despite challenges such as land scarcity that could hinder expansion outside Kumamoto, TSMC's strategy indicates a strong commitment to global diversification. This is crucial given the geopolitical tensions surrounding Taiwan Strait relations. The strategic importance of Japan's semiconductor sector is evidenced by corporate interest from companies such as Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., Samsung Electronics (KS: ) Co., and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ: ).

Cross-industry collaborations are also taking shape, with companies like Denso Corp. contributing to economic growth prospects. According to SMBC Nikko Securities' analysis, these developments are set to significantly boost the GDP of the Kyushu region, which includes Kumamoto, showcasing Japan's increasing value in the global tech landscape and TSMC's comprehensive strategy for worldwide market presence amidst ongoing uncertainties.

(Reuters) - Music industry veteran Jimmy Iovine was sued on Wednesday by an woman who claims she was sexually abused.

In a complaint filed in New York state court in Manhattan, a woman identified only as ""Jane Doe"" said she was sexually abused, forcibly touched and subject to sexual harassment and retaliation in August 2007.

A spokesperson for Iovine said they were ""quite shocked and baffled"" by the alleged claim.

""This inquiry is the first we’ve heard of this matter. No one has ever made a claim like this against Jimmy Iovine, nor have we been contacted or made aware of any complaint by anyone, including this unknown plaintiff prior to now,” the spokesperson said.

The woman is seeking unspecified damages for assault and battery under the Adult Survivors Act, a special New York state law letting women sue their alleged abusers even if statutes of limitations have run out.

Her attorney, Douglas Wigdor, declined further comment.

The law expires after the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday.

The onetime recoding engineer co-founded Interscope Records, a music label associated with West Coast hip hop that is now part of Universal Music Group (AS: ). Iovine later partnered in 2006 with producer Dr. Dre to launch Beats Electronics, a company which Apple (NASDAQ: ) acquired in 2014 for $3 billion.

Others sued under the law include actors Russell Brand and Bill Cosby, former movie producer Harvey Weinstein, former president Donald Trump, and hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, whose case settled after one day.

China’s smartphone market has witnessed a notable shift in sales dynamics, with Apple (NASDAQ: ) experiencing a 4% year-over-year decline in smartphone sales during the recent Singles Day event period. This comes despite JD (NASDAQ: ).com’s report of high transaction volumes exceeding 10 billion yuan ($1.39 billion) for Apple products. The dip contrasts sharply with Huawei’s impressive 66% and Xiaomi’s 28% surge in sales, contributing to an overall 5% boost in the Chinese smartphone sector.

The pricing strategy reveals a competitive landscape, with the iPhone 15 tagged at 5,999 yuan ($832), Huawei’s Mate 60 at 5,499 yuan, and Xiaomi’s Mi 14 at a more modest 3,999 yuan. These price points were critical during the Singles Day shopping spree, which is known for its substantial discounts and has become a significant event for consumer electronics sales in China.

Apple’s latest iPhone 15 series, released late September, faced tough competition as Xiaomi (OTC: ) unveiled its Mi 14 line in late October, swiftly surpassing one million units sold after its debut. Huawei also made headlines earlier with its Mate 60 range launch, gaining nationalistic support for its advanced chip that bypasses U.S. sanctions.

Despite the challenges, industry analysts from IDC suggest a recovery is on the horizon for China's smartphone market after enduring persistent shipment drops. However, Counterpoint Research attributes part of Apple's recent stagnation to supply chain issues that have affected the availability of the latest iPhone models. These disruptions are anticipated to stabilize soon, potentially aiding Apple to regain momentum following this high-volume sales event.

(Reuters) - Elon Musk-owned social media company X could lose as much as $75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year as dozens of major brands pause their marketing campaigns, the New York Times reported on Friday.

Musk backing an antisemitic post on the platform last week has led several companies including Walt Disney (NYSE: ) and Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) to pause their advertisements on the site formerly called Twitter.

X has struck back and sued media watchdog group Media Matters, alleging the organization defamed the platform with a report that said ads for major brands including Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Oracle (NYSE: ) had appeared next to posts touting Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party.

Internal documents viewed by The New York Times this week list more than 200 ad units of companies from the likes of Airbnb, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), many of which have halted or are considering pausing their ads on the social network, the report said.

X said on Friday $11 million in revenue was at risk and the exact figure fluctuated as some advertisers returned to the platform and others increased spending, according to the report.

The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Advertisers have fled X since Musk bought it in October 2022 and reduced content moderation, resulting in a sharp rise in hate speech on the site, according to civil rights groups.

Investing.com -- With investors on tenterhooks over when global interest rates might start to fall, upcoming inflation data this week will be in focus. OPEC+ meets to discuss oil output cuts and data from China will give fresh insights on the economic outlook for the world’s number-two economy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

U.S. inflation data

On the heels of October's unchanged reading on consumer price inflation, markets will be hoping that another U.S. inflation report on Thursday will bolster the case for an end to Federal Reserve .

The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, is expected to have risen in November. The PCE index rose 0.4% in September, matching the rise in August.

The core reading, which strips out food and fuel costs and is considered a better gauge of underlying inflation, is expected to have risen on a year-over-year basis.

Other economic data out during the week includes a index for November on Tuesday - October's reading showed a third straight monthly decline. There will also be the first revision of third quarter , figures on for October, the weekly report on and the Fed’s .

Year-end rally?

Signs the U.S. stock market rally is broadening from the so-called Magnificent Seven of mega-cap growth and technology companies is bolstering investor hopes for a rally through year-end.

The Magnificent Seven group of stocks is made up of Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and they collectively hold a 28% weight in the . They make up nearly 50% of the weighting of the , which is up nearly 47% for the year to date.

Equities have risen sharply, with the broad S&P 500 advancing approximately 10% over the last three weeks, fuelled by falling Treasury yields and cooling inflation readings that could signal the end of Federal Reserve rate hikes.

Investors will get further readings of inflation and consumer confidence (see above) during the week, but stronger-than-expected data could spur a selloff in Treasuries, sending yields higher.

OPEC+ meeting

Oil fell on Friday, but prices notched their first week of gains in over a month ahead of a meeting later this week to decide on production cuts in 2024.

futures settled down 1.4%, at $80.23 a barrel, while fell 2.5%, from Wednesday's close to $75.17. There was no settlement for WTI on Thursday owing to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.

The gains for the week came as OPEC+ prepares for a meeting on Thursday that will have output cuts high on the agenda after recent oil price declines on demand concerns and burgeoning supply, particularly from non-OPEC producers.

The OPEC+ group, comprising of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, surprised the market last Wednesday by delaying its scheduled Nov. 26 meeting to Nov. 30 after producers struggled to reach a consensus on output levels.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds sold the largest volume of U.S. tech and media stocks seen since July in the week to Nov. 24, Goldman Sachs said in a prime brokerage note to clients on Friday, a signal that the popularity of these stocks may be fading.

Crowding into tech stocks, particularly the so-called ""Magnificent 7"", which includes Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), had reached the most intense that Goldman Sachs has seen in 22 years, the bank said earlier last week.

By the end of the week, information technology and communication companies were the most net sold on the prime brokerage trading desk at Goldman, which serves hedge funds, the note said.

It added hedge funds that had been long in these stocks dropped their bets at the fastest pace in nearly eight months.

Traders ditched both long and short bets on software and interactive media companies, while exiting long bets on sellers of semi-conductor equipment.

A long bet is essentially a position that the price of an asset will rally.

Big investors and advisers, including Bill Gross, Mohamed El-Erian and Ryan Israel, chief investment officer of Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, told Reuters this month that a calming in bond markets and the expectations of a pause in US rate hikes might not be enough to lift tech stocks and asset prices, generally.

Technology, media, and telecom stocks make up 30.2% of total U.S. single stock net exposure, down from a year high in late October of 35.9%, the bank said without giving an exact October date.

The most popular tech stocks have been ""priced for perfection"" but a ""reckoning will come"", Amundi's chief investment officer Vincent Mortier said last week.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). is set to end its credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: )., aiming to wrap up their agreement within the next 12 to 15 months. This decision marks a significant shift for the tech giant, which had previously joined forces with Goldman Sachs to offer a credit card in 2019 and a savings account in 2023. The Wall Street Journal, citing inside sources, reported that Goldman Sachs' foray into consumer lending brought about unexpected costs that have led to a strategic reevaluation.

The termination of this partnership will put an end to the products that emerged from the collaboration, including the Apple-branded credit card. Despite the planned exit, Apple has not yet disclosed any details about a new issuer to take over the financial services provided by Goldman Sachs. The move comes after Goldman Sachs experienced significant errors due to the rapid expansion into consumer lending. These errors prompted the bank to consider exiting credit partnerships and to discuss potential handovers with other financial institutions.

American Express Co (NYSE: ). and Synchrony Financial (NYSE: ) were among the companies approached by Goldman Sachs. American Express showed concern about potential loss rates, and while Synchrony Financial appeared interested in taking over the Apple card program, neither company has provided a public response to the inquiries about their involvement.

Goldman Sachs has not offered any comments regarding these developments, and Apple has remained silent on inquiries for input on their future plans. The news of this strategic shift comes at a time when Apple continues to explore the expansion of its services segment, which includes a variety of digital offerings beyond hardware products. The outcome of these discussions and the future of Apple's financial products remain to be seen as the market anticipates the tech giant's next move.

(Reuters) - A Delaware judge said she will decide by Friday whether to give Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) a January trial date over a dispute of how to value truck stop operator Pilot Travel Centers, alongside a related lawsuit by the billionaire Haslam family.

Berkshire already owns 80% of Pilot, having paid the Haslams $2.76 billion for a 38.6% stake in 2017 and $8.2 billion for another 41.4% in January.

The dispute concerns how much Berkshire would owe if the Haslams, including Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, exercised their option to sell the remaining 20% in the first two months of 2024.

Each side accuses the other of trying to manipulate Pilot's earnings, the basis for valuing that stake.

At a Thursday hearing in Delaware Chancery Court, Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn told Berkshire's lawyer Craig Jennings Lavoie: ""I am going to get you an answer by the end of the day tomorrow"" on whether both cases can be tried together.

""I have to be satisfied that there is harm to your client that won't be remedied if I don't give you the equitable relief that you're asking for,"" Zurn said.

The Haslams sued Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire in October, accusing it of seeking a ""windfall"" by adopting ""pushdown"" accounting for Pilot, requiring it take on higher depreciation and amortization costs and lowering earnings.

Berkshire countersued on Nov. 28, saying Jimmy Haslam tried to bribe Pilot executives with millions of dollars to inflate earnings in 2023 at the expense of future years.

BERKSHIRE ALLEGES 'CLOUD OF MISCONDUCT'

At Thursday's hearing, Lavoie said Haslam made ""at least 28"" promises of secret side payments to Pilot executives, at above their annual salaries.

Lavoie said Haslam's push to align the executives' financial interests with his own amounted to a ""cloud of misconduct"" and ""obvious breach of fiduciary duty,"" and Berkshire would be irreparably harmed if forced to possibly overpay for Pilot.

""We don't view it as a particularly complex case,"" Lavoie said.

Anitha Reddy, a lawyer for the Haslams, countered that Berkshire - which has one of corporate America's largest and strongest balance sheets - could not claim irreparable harm from possibly overpaying.

""How could they?"" she said. ""It's just a matter of money.""

According to court papers, the Haslams believe the 20% Pilot stake was worth $3.2 billion before Berkshire's accounting change, an amount Berkshire disputes.

The family also includes former Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam, and Jimmy's father, Jim Haslam, who founded Pilot in 1958 after paying $6,000 for a Virginia gas station.

Pilot is based in Knoxville, Tennessee. It has approximately 800 locations in the United States and Canada, and has this year added $380 million to Berkshire's profit through September.

Buffett said at Berkshire's annual meeting in May he wished he could have bought all of Pilot in 2017, but the Haslams did not want to sell.

Berkshire also owns dozens of other businesses including the BNSF railroad and Geico car insurer, and big stakes in Apple (NASDAQ: ), Bank of America and other stocks.

(Reuters) - We asked ChatGPT, OpenAI's viral chatbot, how it felt on its first birthday. This was its reply:

""Thank you for the birthday wishes! However, it's important to note that as a computer program, I don't have feelings or consciousness, so I don't experience emotions like humans do.""

Still, its uncannily human-like responses have taken the world by storm in the past year. And while it has answered millions of user prompts, its growing influence has raised questions about the role of AI in society.

Its parent, OpenAI, was also jolted this month by a tumultuous boardroom battle that saw the sudden ouster and return of CEO Sam Altman.

ChatGPT became the fastest-growing software application in the world within six months of its launch. It also sparked the launch of rival chatbots from Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and a bevy of startups that tapped the hype to secure billions in funding.

The generative AI craze has disrupted several industries from cloud computing and customer service to movie editing and screenplay writing.

Here are four charts on ChatGPT and the impact of generative AI:

CHATGPT DOMINATES DESPITE RISE OF COMPETITORS

ChatGPT's competitors include Bard, Anthropic's Claude, Character.AI and Microsoft's CoPilot, which have seen a surge in users. ChatGPT, however, commands the lion's share of the market.

CHATGPT APP DOWNLOADS

Six months after ChatGPT's website launch, OpenAI introduced the chatbot application to Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iOS in May and later on Android in July.

Downloads of the app on both platforms have steadily increased on both platforms, with OpenAI seeing revenue from in-app purchases, according to data analytics firm Apptopia.

WINNERS OF THE AI BOOM

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) became the first and the only chip company to join the $1 trillion valuation club and is widely considered the biggest winner of the AI boom due to its position as the key supplier of the chips used to power ChatGPT and other generative AI applications.

With these applications running mostly on the cloud, vendors of cloud computing services, including Microsoft, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet, have also seen their shares surge.

BIG TECH POURS BILLIONS INTO AI

ChatGPT's launch sparked massive investments from the top tech players.

Microsoft and Alphabet have invested billions to improve their cloud computing capabilities and take on more AI workloads as businesses embrace such tools.

CONTROVERSIES

OpenAI and its backer Microsoft have been slapped with several lawsuits that have been brought by groups of copyright owners, including authors John Grisham, George R.R. Martin and Jonathan Franzen, over the alleged misuse of their work to train AI systems. The companies have denied the allegations.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chatgpt-one-year-on-from-viral-ai-bot-to-openais-boardroom-battle-3246771,0.021,0.906,0.072,0.97

NEW YORK(Reuters) - As U.S. stocks sit on hefty gains at the close of a rollercoaster year, investors are eyeing factors that could sway equities in the remaining weeks of 2023, including tax loss selling and the so-called Santa Claus rally.

The key catalyst for stocks will likely continue to be the expected trajectory of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Evidence of cooling economic growth has fueled bets that the U.S. central bank could begin cutting rates as early as the first half of 2024, sparking a rally that has boosted the 19.6% year-to-date and taken the index to a fresh closing high for the year on Friday.

At the same time, seasonal trends have been particularly strong this year. In September, historically the weakest month for stocks, the S&P 500 fell nearly 5%. Stocks swung wildly in October, a month noted for its volatility. The S&P 500 gained nearly 9% gain in November, historically a strong month for the index.

""We've had a solid year, but history shows that December can sometimes move to its own beat,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.

Investors next week will be watching U.S. employment data, due out on Dec. 8, to see whether economic growth is continuing to level off.

Overall, December has been the second-best month for the S&P 500, with the index up an average of 1.54% for the month since 1945, according to CFRA. It is also the month most likely to post a gain, with the index rising 77% of the time, the firm's data showed.

Research from LPL Financial (NASDAQ: ) showed that the second half of December tends to outshine the first part of the month. The S&P 500 has gained an average of 1.4% in the second half of December in so-called Santa Claus rallies, compared with a 0.1% gain in the first half, according to LPL's analysis of market moves going back to 1950.

Stocks that have not performed well, however, may face additional pressure in December from tax loss selling, as investors get rid of losers to lock in write-offs before year-end. If history is any guide, some of those shares may rebound later in the month and into January as investors return to undervalued names, analysts said.

Since 1986, stocks that were down 10% or more between January and the end of October have beaten the S&P 500 by an average of 1.9% over the next three months, according to BofA Global Research. PayPal (NASDAQ: ) Holdings, CVS Health (NYSE: ), and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: ) Co are among the stocks the bank recommends buying for a tax-related bounce, BofA noted in a late October report.

""The market advance has been extraordinarily narrow this year, and there's reason to believe that some sectors and stocks will really take it on the chin until they get some relief in January,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

Despite the market's hefty year-to-date rise, investment portfolios are likely to have plenty of underperforming stocks. Nearly 72% of the S&P 500's gain has been driven by a cluster of megacap stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), which have an outsized weighting in the index, data from S&P Dow Jones Indices showed.

Many other names have languished: The equal-weighted S&P 500, whose performance is not skewed by big tech and growth stocks, is up around 6% in 2023.

Some worry that investor over-exuberance may have already set in after November's big rally, which spurred huge moves in some of the market's more speculative names.

Streaming service company Roku (NASDAQ: ) soared 75% in November, for instance, while cryptocurrency firm Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) Global climbed 62% and Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation Fund was up 31%, its best performance of any month in the last five years.

Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at BofA Global Research, said in a Friday note that the firm's contrarian Bull & Bear indicator - which assesses factors such as hedge fund positioning, equity flows and bond flows - had moved out of the ""buy"" zone for the first time since mid-October.
